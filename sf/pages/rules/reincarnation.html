					Reincarnation Expanded
				</h1>
				<p>
					The version of reincarnate found in the standard
					Player's Handbook may be enough to sate
					some adventurers... well, at least the BORING
					ones that is! This document outlines an
					alternate version of the spell reincarnate. One
					that any DM leading a party of powergamers
					would best avoid using. For all else, enjoy.
				</p>
				<div id="Start">
					<h4>
						The Steps to Reincarnation!
					</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Roll on the Base Table</li>
						<li>Roll on the Sex Table (result has no effect on a character's gender)</li>
						<li>Roll on the Successfulness Table and follow instructions from there</li>
						<li>Roll on any additional applicable tables</li>
						<li>Finish up by rolling on any applicable subrace tables for your race</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>
						Subraces!
					</h4>
					<p>
						An asterisk next to a race indicates that there is a
						matching subrace table to roll on. For instance, the
						Elements table would be used to determine what
						kind of Genasi, elemental, etc. a character ends up
						as. There are also tables for dragon types, tiefling
						types, and many more. Find these tables in the
						Subraces section at the end of the book.

							<p>
								For the most part, the powers in the previous table simply correspond to sorcerer classes, but if the player rolls psionic powers there are a few options. They could gain access to mystic levels, or could gain the ability to speak telepathically, or gain a use of rary's telepathic bond twice per long rest, or the ability to lift objects telekinetically, using their Intelligence to calculate the amount they can lift instead of Strength. It's really up to the player and their DM to collaborate on.
