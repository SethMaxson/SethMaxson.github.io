				<h1>Pantheon</h1>

				<p>The following is the most widely accepted pantheon in the known world. While there are countless other systems
					of belief, nearly everyone agrees that these beings play a part in the everyday function of reality.</p>

				<p><b>GOD OF CHAOS - Spaxis.</b> Spaxis thrives on chance and relishes absurdity. He frequently offers deals to
					mortals under various guises, only to have the deal backfire on his victims in unpredictable ways. His arrival is
					usually signaled by loud cackling. Over the centuries, this behavior has caused many a mortal to refer to Spaxis
					as THE MAD GOD.</p>

				<p><b>GODDESS OF CREATION - Rachi.</b> Rachi is the flower child of the gods. She promotes new ideas, new
					inventions, and all other general newness. Because of this, she is often associated with science and invention,
					and is often thought to be the patron of tinkerers.</p>

				<!-- <p><b>GOD OF DEATH - Immordan.</b> <span class="missing">DECEASED</span> Most mortals know little of Immordan, for he usually only reveals himself to
					them at the time of their death. He watches over the souls of the deceased. This includes ensuring that everyone
					is assigned an afterlife befitting their deeds during their time on the mortal coil.</p> -->

				<p><b>GOD OF DEATH - Namfoodle.</b>

				</p>

				<!-- <p><b>GODDESS OF THE HARVEST - Graisum.</b>
					Graisum is responsible for maintaining the balance of nature. Farms, forests, and all naturally occurring biomes fall under her domain. She is depicted in most religious texts as somewhat aloof, caring far more for flora than fauna.
				</p> -->

				<p><b>GOD OF THE HARVEST - Bud. (Lord God King Brrawd)</b>
					Bud is responsible for maintaining the balance of nature. Farms, forests, and all naturally occurring biomes fall under his domain.
				</p>

				<!-- <p><b>GODDESS OF LAW - Larazi.</b>
					Larazi is the guardian of law, order, and justice. Out of all the gods, she is easily one of the most respected. And feared. Her tenets require that her followers adhere to a strict code. Breaking the code is severely punished in nearly all cases. While few can argue that Larazi is unjust, she tends to be unforgiving.
				</p> -->

				<p><b>GOD OF LAW - Falimur.</b>
					Falimur is the guardian of law, order, and justice. He was mortal until relatively recently, and was a loyal servant of the gods during his previous life. His tenets require that his followers adhere to a strict code. Breaking the code is severely punished in many cases.<br/>
					<br/>
					Despite being one of the youngest members of the pantheon, his prior service meant he was accepted by most of the other deities with open arms upon his ascension.
				</p>

				<p><b>GOD OF LIFE - Vidan.</b> Vidan is responsible for ushering new souls into existence. He is often regarded as
					the kindest of the gods, and is beloved by most mortals. It has been said that he has retrieved the souls of dead
					mortals on a few occasions so that they could be reincarnated into a new life. If this is true, it doesn't happen
					often. These souls would have to be retrieved from the underworld, and Immordan is not easy to steal from.</p>

				<p><b>GODDESS OF WISDOM - Notriv.</b> Notriv is the patron deity of lessons well-learned. She is thought to be
					something of a parental figure to most mortal life, and is associated with knowledge and self-preservation. What many people
					consider to be common sense, is believed by others to be the guiding voice of Notriv.</p>

				<p><b>GODDESS OF STORMS - Tordanei.</b> Tordanei is the most passionate of the gods, and changes moods as often as
					the wind changes directions. Despite her emotional inconsistency, Toranei is generally believed to be benevolent.
				</p>

				<!-- <p><b>GOD OF TIME - Chromus.</b> Chromus is the deity responsible for the passage of time. Ancient texts speak of
					time resembling a roaring river, eroding everything in its path. Chromus harnessed this flow and controls it,
					allowing mortals a chance at a proper lifespan. This is a very delicate balance. If too much of the flow were to
					be let through, the lifespans of most mortals would be over in a moment. If too little were to be let through, the
					passage of time could stop completely, resulting in the material plane being locked in one moment forever.</p> -->

				<p><b>GODDESS OF TIME - Aetas.</b> Aetas is the deity responsible for the passage of time. Ancient texts speak of
					time resembling a roaring river, eroding everything in its path. Aetas harnesses this flow and controls it,
					allowing mortals a chance at a proper lifespan. This is a very delicate balance. If too much of the flow were to
					be let through, the lifespans of most mortals would be over in a moment. If too little were to be let through, the
					passage of time could stop completely, resulting in the material plane being locked in one moment forever.</p>

				<p><b>GOD OF WAR - Mortadus.</b> Mortadus lives for combat. He becomes restless in times of peace, and has even
					been known to stage large gladiatorial tournaments for his own amusement.</p>

				<p><b>LORD OF THE CHAMPION - Lonic.</b> Lonic is the patron deity of heroes and adventurers who seek to better the
					world. Lonic's core tenet is courage, and he strongly encourages his followers to overthrow evil wherever it
					arises. He and Fouvil are mortal enemies.</p>

				<p><b>LORD OF THE VILE - Fouvil.</b> Fouvil is the dark god of those who seek to obtain power through whatever
					means necessary. His worshippers almost universally identify with evil alignments. People of Neutral or Good
					alignments tend to despise Fouvil. Fouvil and Lonic have a long-standing rivalry, and constantly instruct their
					followers to wage war on each other.</p>

						There was once a reclusive druid who loved to sing. Despite his hatred of the outside world, he wished to perform as part of a barbershop quartet. During one of his lonely practice sessions, he began to hear a wolf howling along. This continued the next day, and the day after that. Over time, he and the wolf became fast friends. Hoping to make his barbershop quartet dream a reality, the druid awakened the wolf so that he could howl with actual lyrics.
