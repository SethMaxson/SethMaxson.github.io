			"An organized Ysoki crime syndicate that is very selective in its members. It is led by Frankie Blue-Eyes, \"affectionately\" dubbed <i>The Rat King</i>. Gang members are typically seen in tailored suits and fedoras or trilby hats. They deal in all manner of contraband, and own a large number of swanky nightclubs that double as fronts for their black market shops. Despite their questionable moral fiber, the gang has a reputation for being militaristically opposed to racism of any kind."
