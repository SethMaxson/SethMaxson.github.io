This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.</li><li>1st (Instantaneous): You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.</li><li>2nd (Environmental): You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).</li><li>2nd (Instantaneous): You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.</li><li>3rd (Environmental): You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration (Core Rulebook 260).</li><li>3rd (Instantaneous): You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.</li><li>4th (Environmental): You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.</li><li>4th (Instantaneous): You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).</li><li>5th (Environmental): You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.</li><li>5th (Instantaneous): You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.</li><li>6th (Environmental): You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).</li></ul>"

								"You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.",
								"Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.",
								"Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.",
								"You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.",
								"You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem."
