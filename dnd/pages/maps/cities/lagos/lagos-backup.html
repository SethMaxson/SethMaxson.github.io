						Firelake
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Firelake</h1>
							<p>The Firelake is seldom visited by outsiders, and for good reason. The native firenewts view outsiders as a source of food, and most strangers to the island don't survive more than a few hours. The few survivors who find their way back home tell tales of how they won their freedom by conquering a challenge issued by the firenewts.</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>The Firelake civilization is far more barbaric than what most humanoids are accustomed to. Firenewts believe themselves to be the gods' chosen people, and allow very few non-firenewts to roam their mountain haven.</p>
							<p>Only firenewts are welcome in the caverns of Firelake. Any other creatures caught on the island are promptly captured and stored to be cooked for the next meal. However, it is common for firenewts to issue a challenge to their prisoners before eating them. Any prisoner who conquers this challenge is released, and on rare occasions made an honorary firenewt.</p>

						Tahl Town
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Tahl Town</h1>
							<p>
								Tahl Town is often referred to as "Bandit Town" by those loyal to Amarillo. Tahl Town has few modern conveniences, and its people have a gruffness about them. Most of the residents of Tahl Town are outcasts. Some are criminals on the lam, paupers who couldn't afford life in Amarillo, or mages hoping to perform magical experiments without government regulation. Regardless of each citizen's reason for living in Tahl Town, they almost universally share a hatred of larger governments.
							</p>
							<p>
								Tahl Town is named after its founder, Joban Tahl. Once a simple farmer living outside of Amarillo, Tahl became frustrated with the rule of the Lims. He vowed to end the tyranny of the Lims. Many of his peers shared his views, and gladly followed him into the wilds to the west of the capital. The new alliance built a city to call their own, and declared themselves to be an independent kingdom.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Tahl Town's laws are very minimalistic. Because of this, a traveler's experiences in Tahl Town are very dependent upon their strength. A weak traveler will likely be assaulted, robbed, or worse. A more formidable traveler may find that they enjoy the freedom offered by the city.
							</p>
							<p>
								Tahl Town's has no formal education system, and most of its citizens come from humble backgrounds with little academic prowess. As a result, their view of the world is very skewed. Tahl Town's population is mostly human, but other races are welcomed as long as the citizens are already familiar with them. More exotic races are often mistrusted, if not outright driven out of town.

						Amarillo
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Amarillo</h1>
							<p>
								Amarillo has long been ruled by the Lim clan. Members of the Lim family are often plagued by madness. This combination of political power and insanity often proves to be a potent mix, and has earned Amarillo a reputation as a force to be reckoned with. Within the last century, the Lim family has used this power to intimidate many smaller kingdoms into subservience. These kingdoms have become provinces within the greater kingdom of Amarillo.
							</p>
							<p>
								Members of the Lim clan tend to perish at a young age, and seldom due to natural causes. The high mortality rate among Lims has driven them nearly out of existence. Only two known heirs remain.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Under the watchful eyes of the Lims, Amarillo was crafted to become an economic powerhouse. There is a tremendous disparity between the wealthy and the impoverished, with almost citizens between these two financial standings. This is a frequent cause of derision among Amarillo's residents. The upper class tend to view the poor as more beast then human, while the lower class often believe the upper class to be nothing more than uppity thieves.
							</p>
							<p>
								Amarillo's populous is primarily human, but other races are welcome (as long as they are good for business).

						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Budopolis</h1>
							<p>
								Little is known of the origins of the civilization formerly known as "Bubble-Town." The city was renamed "Budopolis" recently after a change of leadership.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Budopolis is inhabited by giant shark and lizard people with a constant case of the munchies. Visitors are welcome, but may also become food. It's lit fam.

							<h1>Sky Isle</h1>
							<p>
								The unofficially dubbed 'Sky Isle' seems unperturbed by the laws of gravity. It is actually a small fragment of another plane that has begun to bleed into this one through a planar rift.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								The ancient village atop the Sky Isle had long been abandoned when it bled through into this plane. It has since become a melting pot of sorts, with the bulk of its populace comprised of pirates, Amarillan soldiers, or Grung.
							</p>
							<p>
								The residents of the Sky Isle are an unpredictable, and often untrusting lot. Survival of visitors is not guaranteed, regardless of race or allegiance.

						Vidan's Rest
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Vidan's Rest</h1>
							<p>Vidan's Rest is a sprawling city on the coast of the Verdant Isle. The city was founded millennia ago by Vidan himself, so that he could teach its residents how to live in harmony with all life. Nothing in Vidan's Rest is made of wood. The stone streets are lined with polished stone structures and luminous palm trees. Due to its location and status as a market hub, Vidan's Rest sees a large number of visitors on a daily basis. </p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>Vidan's Rest is a trade hub, and a popular travel destination for those who wish to experience the Verdant Isle. The people of Vidan's Rest are exceptionally welcoming of any outsiders, and many earn a living offering food or shelter for travelers.</p>
							<p>
								All non-violent, living creatures are welcome in Vidan's Rest. Citizens of Vidan's Rest abhor killing of any kind, and undeath is seen as an affront to the natural cycle of life. Undead are ritualistically turned, and anyone witnessed killing a living thing is given a Life Penalty.

						Graisham
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Graisham</h1>
							<p>
								Graisham has one of the highest land to citizen ratio of any charted settlement. Legends say that Tordanei used these grounds eons ago to hone her weather controlling abilities. In her training, Tordanei caused fracture-like ridges to erupt from the ground, separating Graisham into 5 distinct segments. She then used these to experiment with new climates. The goddess Graisum was delighted at her sister Tordanei's handiwork, and promptly set to work filling these climate fragments with natural life.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								The climate displaced center of Graisham is home to the goddess Graisum and a small handful of carefully chosen followers. They are fiercely protective of this territory and the plant life within it. While most people are unable to survive within the circle, small farms pepper the outlying area. The largest cluster of civilization lies at the base of one of the ridges, and is populated by devout followers of Graisum.
							</p>
							<p>
								Most people who travel to Graisham do so during a religious pilgrimage. The vast majority wish to make an offering to Graisum in exchange for blessings upon their harvest, but there are some who make offerings to Tordanei. While Tordenei is seldom seen in Graisham, it is said that she returns frequently to keep up the climate zones for her sister.
							</p>
							<p>
								Nearly all races are welcome on the outskirts of the climate circle, so long as they respect nature. All Graishamites detest destruction of plants, but none so much as Graisham's chosen followers. Many an adventurer has entered the climate circle, only to be slain as punishment for treading on a sacred blade of grass.

						Aphotia
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Aphotia</h1>
							<p>
								An underground city carved out of solid rock as a safe haven for races unwelcome in the surface world. The founders of Aphotia were primarily drow, deep gnome, and gray dwarves. As a result, the city is kept very dark to accommodate creatures with an aversion to light.
							</p>
							<p>
								Aphotia's favored aesthetic is neon. This allows for a very distinct visual flavor, while also giving off very little light. This is used to highlight focal points in architecture, entrances to buildings, and to provide the illusion of color to nearby objects.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Aphotia is unconcerned by the races of its visitors. However, light is a controlled substance. Creating anything brighter than the dimmest of lights results in almost immediate execution.

								Of all the major hub cities on Lagos, Laketon is the most easygoing. Its position between a lake basin and the ocean means its citizens never want for food. Living in such abundance has caused the Laketonians to adopt a much slower way of life, and embrace many water-based sports.

The Faire family is the primary supplier of food for the city of Amarillo. While this provides enough income to keep the farm operational, recent advances in transportation have drastically reduced the farms profitability.

								Thistleton is home to a race of peculiar frog people known as Grippli. It was built to be a safe haven for the Grippli and their Fey allies, and is very well hidden deep within the trees. The existence and approximate location of Thistleton is widely known, but few outsiders know how to find it.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Thistleton's residents often refer to themselves as "the good folk", and this largely holds true. An evil Grippli is almost unheard of.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Grippli are a simple people. Most are content to live out their days under the rule of their queen, or "Tribe Mother", and remain in the forest. Many Grippli live their entire lives without ever leaving the forest or meeting other races. Because of this, they are very wary of outsiders. They will not attack unless provoked, but most Grippli will hide from any outsiders.

						Okham

							<h1>Okham</h1>
							<p>
								Okham is a small but remarkably sophisticated city on the Verdant Isle. Okham was founded by 5 tinkerers who wanted a workshop far away from the any lesser minds. Over time, their ambitions grew, and the town grew with them. The tinkerers recruited citizens with the promise of free homes for anyone able to aid in the advance of science.
							</p>
							<p>
								Okham's citizens are all scientists or tinkerers. The city is run by a council of elected officials known as <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The Razor</span>. Candidates are usually selected based on prior achievements, or sheer sharpness of wit.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Okham is a scientific community above all else. Intelligence and innovation are essential qualities in any persons looking to become citizens.
							</p>
							<p>
								Okhamites value brains over brawn, and have little interest in a persons' race or beliefs. Members of any race are welcome, but all newcomers must either pass the entrance exam or possess an invitation from a member of The Razor.
								<!-- One of the council members has an unseemly love of coin, and has taken to accepting bribes in exchange for invitations. The recent influx of citizens with average intelligence and above-average wealth has begun to cause civil unrest. -->

								Recent advances in airship technology have all but destroyed the traditional sea-pirate career field. As a result, Southport has had to turn to other sources of income.

							<h1>Elmusk</h1>
							<p>
								Elmusk is a small settlement built around a large tower. The tower is inhabited by a strange old gnome known as "The Right Honorable Royal Highness Emperor Princess Jeeb the Wise, First of His Name, Rocker of Parties, Petter of Small Mammals, and Generally Good Guy". The Elmusk has no official system of government, but the citizens usually look to the sole resident of the tower for guidance and wisdom.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Visitors of all races are welcome in Elmusk. Well, maybe not Hobgoblins. They smell funny.

						Notriven
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Notriven</h1>
							<p>
								Notriven is a mountaintop monument to the goddess of wisdom, Notriv. Ancient traditions often use altitude to symbolize wisdom, and teachings stressed the value of traveling to broaden one's mind.
							</p>
							<p>
								Notriven is not a town or settlement, but Aarakocra often use the surrounding mountain peaks as nesting grounds.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Notriven is an important landmark for followers of Notriv. The long journey up the mountain was thought to be a demonstration of one's dedication to experiencing all the world has to offer. The advent of airships has changed this pilgrimage, and caused a rift in Notriv's worshippers. Purists insist on making the trek up the mountain on foot, while the other sect believes that airship travel is the wiser method.
							</p>
							<p>
								Notriven Aarakocra are friendly with outsiders for most of the year, but their demeanor changes drastically around the spring mating season. Aarakocra remain friendly up until their eggs are laid, with some becoming extra amicable with compatible visitors. Once their eggs are laid, the Aarakocra become defensive and reclusive until the eggs are hatched.

						Salem
						<span class="city-preview">
							<h1>Salem</h1>
							<p>
								Salem was once a modest town populated by humans. However, it was destroyed centuries ago for reasons that have long been forgotten.
							</p>

							<h1>Culture.</h1>
							<p>
								Salem was originally a somber place, constantly beset by plagues and curses. Over time, its citizens either perished, or left to find a home with less murderous intent. The town lay empty for centuries afterwards, becoming a popular subject for conspiracy theorists and campfire stories.
							</p>
							<p>
								Rumor has it that those brave enough to enter Salem's borders can hear the corpses of its people clawing at the earth, trying to escape their eternal rest.

								Mortadus' Colosseum is usually spoken of in awed whispers. It is one of few places where a mortal is guaranteed to be in the presence of a god, but with this honor comes a great cost. Countless warriors have met their end here, trying to prove themselves to Mortadus.
