						<div class="name">Friend-Hammer</div>
						<div class="properties">Warhammer, Rare (Requires Attunement)</div>
						The Friend-Hammer is the weapon of choice for guards in Vidan's Rest. The weathered bronze head sits atop a handle
						cut from an oaken branch. It is common for the handle of a Friend-Hammer to be covered in a thin layer of moss.<br/>
						<br/>
						While attuned to this weapon, you have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by an attack with this weapon is immediately stabilized.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Spear of the Confectioner</div>
						<div class="properties">Spear, unique</div>
						If one squints really hard, the pointy end of this spear looks almost like a sharpened spatula. This item has been imbued with a complex combination of enchantments, made to allow a user to murder their enemies and make desert at the same time. Killing any living creature with this weapon will result in their corpse immediately being true polymorphed into a cinnamon pastry.<br/>
						<br/>
						You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Albert's Dagger of Ravenous Hunger</div>
						<div class="properties">Shortsword, unique</div>
						This dagger was crafted by a particularly demented goblin for removing the still-beating hearts of his victims. If this weapon is used to strike a blow that would reduce a creature to 2 or fewer hit points, the blade automatically adjusts the trajectory of the strike to kill the target. <br/>
						<br/>
						<b>Essence Thief.</b> If this blade is used to cut the heart out of a newly deceased victim, the wielder can make a dc15 constitution check to consume the heart. On a successful roll, 1d8 hit points are restored to the wielder.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Crippling Bow</div>
						<div class="properties">Bow, unique</div>
						An otherworldly hatred is channeled through this bow. For reasons unknown, it seems determined to cripple short humanoids. Any attacks made against humanoids whose size is Small have advantage, but these attacks always land in the targets kneecaps. If a humanoid of size Small tries to wield this bow, they must make a make a dc18 strength check. On a failed roll the target takes 1d8 psychic damage from the sheer force of hatred emanating from the bow.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Grandstaff of Greater Haze</div>
						<div class="properties">Staff, unique</div>
						Legend says that this staff was carved from the remains of a wood woad that had lived for millennia. The residual magic energy allows this staff to serve as an arcane focus. Once per short rest, this staff can be used to create a 50' cloud of thick, strange-smelling smoke that dissipates after one hour.  Any creatures inside the cloud have their vision reduced to 10' until they exit the cloud.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Fluted Staff of Wind</div>
						<div class="properties">Staff, very rare (requires attunement)</div>
						This staff is hollow with holes carved throughout the outer shell, giving it the appearance of a dramatically oversized flute. This design affords the staff a surprising ability to cut through the air. Once per short rest the wielder can spin this staff above their head to generate lift, allowing them to jump up to 60'. +2 to attack rolls.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Wand of Unrivaled Merit</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, unique</div>
						This sinister wand was once used by a grung sorceror to deal with a rival for the position of archmage. Can be used twice per long rest to change the color of any creature to purple. This color change is permanent for grung, but is reversed after an hour for all other creatures. Grants +1 to spell save dc.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Obsidian Echo Blade</div>
						<div class="properties">Longsword, unique</div>
						A jet black blade once wielded by an elite elf warrior, trained in the art of hunting fearsome beasts. It is said that the warrior's senses were so attuned that he was able to use a form of echo-location by hitting the blade against a cave wall. Can be used once per short rest to make a dc16 dexterity check in dark places to perform echo-location. Upon a successful roll, wielder is granted knowledge of the geography and population of the area within a 70' radius. +2 to damage rolls made with this item.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Pendant of Silence</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, uncommon</div>
						Invented by a witch who took a part time-job as a librarian after her retirement. The pendant has soundwave cancelling properties which prevent anything within a 5' radius from making any sound.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Blue Dragon Scale Mail</div>
						<div class="properties">Medium Armor, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)<br/>
							AC 14 + Dex (max 2)</div>
							Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to lightning damage.<br/>
							<br/>
							Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest blue dragon within 30 miles of you. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.<br/>
							<br/>
							The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (Dexterity) checks.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Merry Straw Hat</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</div>
						This plain-looking, wide-brimmed straw hat fits snugly on your head. While attuned to this item, your body is somewhat elastic, increasing your reach on all melee actions (attacks, grapple checks, item usage, etc.) by 5 feet. However, your swim speed is reduced by half.<br/>
						<br/>
						Once a day, you may enhance your body's elasticity, increasing your reach by a further 5 feet and giving you resistance to bludgeoning damage, but you can no longer swim. These properties last until your next long rest.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Lunar Tiara</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</div>
						This crescent-shaped golden tiara sits comfortably on your brow. While attuned to this tiara, you may designate two sets of clothing or armor (any configuration or permutation of items). As an action, you may swap from one set of equipment to the other. Items not currently being equipped or worn are stored in a personal demiplane, and do not need to be re-attuned.<br/><br/>
						Every day, you may cast the moonbeam spell a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all uses of this spell at dusk. Every time you cast moonbeam in this manner, your clothes become increasingly frilly and are adorned with progressively more ribbons. The frills and ribbons vanish after completing a long rest.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Headband of Leaves</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</div>
						This black headband has a silver forehead protector inscribed with the rune of a leaf. When you are struck by a melee attack or fail a Dexterity saving throw, you may use your reaction to make a Dexterity check. On an 11 or higher, you are replaced by a log and reappear within 30 feet of your current position, taking no damage. You may use this a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), recharging when you finish a long rest.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Orb of Beast Taming</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</div>
						This wooden ball fits comfortably in the palm of your hand and is covered in special magical marks. When you invoke the command word, you may use a bonus action to make a ranged attack and throw the ball, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the target is a beast, it is turned into life energy and absorbed into the ball, and must make a Strength saving throw. On a success, it forces its way out of confinement; on a failure, it is trapped in stasis and does not age, nor does it require food, drink, or air.<br/>
						<br/>
						As a bonus action, you may release the beast from the orb; it has been magically tamed and will now follow your orders. You may return the beast to the orb at any time; if unconscious, it will be stabilized. The beast is considered attuned to this particular orb, and you cannot catch another beast in this manner without releasing the first one. After releasing it, it will no longer be considered tamed and will react accordingly.<br/>
						<br/>
						The saving throw DC for the creature to break free of the orb is 18 minus its challenge rating. It has advantage on this saving throw if it is above 75% of its maximum hit points, and disadvantage if it is below 25%.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Falcon's Wing</div>
						<div class="properties">Weapon (any bow or crossbow), uncommon (requires attunement)</div>
						While attuned to this, your arrows magically wrap around corners and bends. You ignore cover that is 5 feet wide or smaller. Additionally, the bow has 1 charge that can be spent to cast feather fall on yourself. Every dawn roll a d6; on a 6 Falcon's Wing is recharged.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Thunderstep Quiver</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</div>
						A slender case banded with copper ribs and needled with feathered patterns, this quiver has similar properties to a thunderbird nest, allowing it to apply a special enchantment to no more than three arrows at a time. These thunderstep arrows lose their special properties if removed from the quiver for more than 1 minute. Once lost or destroyed, each arrow can be replaced using a non-magical arrow at the end of a long rest, causing their fletching to turn a stormy grey and their head to acquire a coppery sheen.<br/>
						<br/>
						Whenever you make a ranged bow attack against a target within 80 feet, you may use one of these thunderstep arrows. The attack is magical and deals lightning damage, as it flies from your bow with a tail of crackling light, and you follow in its wake like thunder follows lightning. You immediately teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your target with a low, bone-shaking rumble, destroying the arrow and forcing every creature within 5 feet of your new position to make a Constitution save (DC12) or suffer 1d6 thunder damage and fall prone.<br/>
						<br/>
						If your attack misses, the DM determines where the thunderstep arrow lands and teleports you – usually no more than 10 feet from your original target, though a natural roll of 1 or obstacles like wind wall may throw you further away. You may target an inanimate object with a thunderstep arrow.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Brace of Manual Labor</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, uncommon</div>
						This metal skeleton fits over a medium-sized humanoid's body and manipulates leverage and force to greatly enhance the wearer's lifting power. It takes one minute to don, can be worn comfortably underneath any armor, and does not impede your movement.<br/>
						<br/>
						While wearing the brace, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. In addition, you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, drag, and lift objects.
					</div>
					<div class="item">
						<div class="name">Pendant of Silence</div>
						<div class="properties">Wondrous item, uncommon</div>
						Invented by a witch who took a part time-job as a librarian after her retirement. The pendant has soundwave cancelling properties which prevent anything within a 5' radius from making any sound.

						<div class="name">Infinite Elixir of Unknowable Outcome</div>
						<div class="properties">Potion, very rare</div>
						A bottle of a viscous, forest green liquid whose effect is entirely random. The entire contents must be consumed for any effect to occur, but the liquid replenishes itself at midnight. Upon drinking, roll 1d20:
