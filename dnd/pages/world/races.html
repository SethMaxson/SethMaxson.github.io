								<br/>
								The most famous tribe of Aarakocra make their home at Notriven. Here they worship the goddess of wisdom, Notriv, and watch over the people below.

								<div class="name">Dragonborn</div>
								<div class="properties">Burninating the peasants.</div>
								<p>
									Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.

									Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs-these common threads unite all dwarves.

								<div class="properties">Aloof defenders.</div>
								<input type="text" class="bg" value="/img/locales/elven_city.jpg" style="display:none;" />
								<p>
									Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.

								Firbolg tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, preferring to spend their days in quiet harmony with the woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.

								<input type="text" class="bg" value="/img/locales/shawn-lee-744890701978360690.jpg" style="display:none;" />
								A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.
							</div>
							<div class="race slide">
								<div class="name">Goblin</div>

								Goblins are tiny, green humanoids with a penchant for arson. Most civilized races consider goblins frightening or disgusting. For this reason, they are seldom seen in cities.<br/>
								<br/>
								Goblins are prevalent throughout the entirety of the world, but most prefer to live somewhere with plenty of dark corners in which to hide.

								At the highest mountain peaks-far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl-dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.

								<div class="name">Grippli</div>
								<div class="properties">The good folk.</div>
								<input type="text" class="bg" value="/img/locales/redwood_forest.jpg" style="display:none;" />
								Grippli are simple folk. They look like frogs, live in trees, and mostly keep to themselves. The majority of grippli go their entire lives without ever leaving their home forest, but it is not uncommon for a grippli to decide to broaden their horizons.<br/>
								<br/>
								Most grippli seldom stray far from the treeline, but grippli adventurers can turn up at any corner of the world.
