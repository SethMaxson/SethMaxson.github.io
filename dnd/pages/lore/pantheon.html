				<p>
					Geoss is a world full of mystery and opportunity, watched over by many deities. The ranks of the deities have grown slowly over the centuries. The following is the most widely accepted pantheon in the known world. While there are countless other systems of belief, nearly everyone agrees that these beings play a part in the everyday function of reality.

					<p>
						The remaining gods and goddesses each swear their fealty to a single member of the prime pantheon. These subservient divines are known as lesser deities or demigods. While the origin of prime deities predates recorded history, most of the lesser deities are mortals who ascended to godhood. This occurs when a mortal receives genuine, sincere worship from another mortal. The strength of the worshiper's belief causes the recipient of the worship to transcend into divinity. The more active worshippers a demigod has, the more powerful they become. Theoretically, a demigod could become a prime deity with enough worshippers.
