									Shamous was forever changed the day he saw his village burned to the ground by a rampaging dragon. Finding himself suddenly alone, Shamous wandered the forest seeking purpose. He met another young firbolg survivor, Sonya. They quickly kindled a romance.
								</p>
								<p>
									After several happy years together, Sonya revealed a startling truth. She was the dragon who had razed his childhood home, and chose to take firbolg form afterwards out of guilt. She bore the village no ill-will, but had not yet gained full control over her strength. Shamous was devastated, but chose to forgive Sonya.
								</p>
								<p>
									Eventually, Shamous and Sonya had a child, whom they named Eve. Shamous finally felt at peace. Fate, however, had other plans. Rumors of Sonya's true draconic nature began to spread in the surrounding villages. A mob of panicked villagers attacked during the night. Shamous fought with all his might, but lacked the strength to repel the horde. Once again, he watched as his home and loved ones were burned to the ground.
								</p>
								<p>
									Losing everything twice left Shamous a broken man. He now wanders the world looking for a way to be reunited with his wife and daughter. He will stop at nothing until he achieves this goal.

										From Dom:

										Jasper is a solider frozen from the past. Jasper grew up with her sister Mirage and they were inseparable. When Mirage got older she decided she wanted to go into the military and be a solider. Jasper was not used to being away from her sister but Jasper was a male. Jasper worked part time as a Simic scientist and decided to do tests on himself. After some experiments Jasper was able to convert himself into a female to join the military with his sister but not with repercussions. Jasper not only had a new body but powers and wings to go with it. Jasper and Mirage discussed the new change and decided to try and sign up. Jasper made it through training by carefully concealing her wings. But one night an officer went into Mirage’s and Jasper’s bunker and saw Jasper’s wings. The officer demanded Jasper come with him and they went off to his station. When the officer pulled up her file and looked through it and noticed that Jasper used to be a man but transitioned into a female. Outraged the officer was angry this was overlooked and decided to put Jasper down as dishonorable discharge because he felt like just because Jasper identified as female doesn’t make her a true female.

									</p> -->
									Jasper was orphaned at an early age, and subsequently raised by her elder sister, Mirage. Jasper spent her childhood years learning to value the greater good, and practicing arcane magic under the guidance of her sister. When Jasper was nearing adulthood, her sister was called away to war. Jasper used the resources in her sister's arcane study to undergo alterations in order to follow her to war.
								</p>
								<p>
									Jasper proved to be a ferocious warrior with a strong moral compass. However, her commander discovered that she had undergone mutations in order to enlist. Learning that she was unqualified for service, the commander discharged her immediately.
								</p>
								<p>
									Jasper continued to do her best to serve the public as a wandering adventurer. Her success was mixed, but she remained content in the knowledge that she served the greater good. Eventually her adventures saw her turned to stone. She spent roughly 5 centuries in this state before eventually being thawed by <span class="ally">Cog</span> to once again fight for the good of Geoss.
								</p>
								<!-- <p>
									Jasper was once a male, but the same experiments that gave Jasper her powers also changed her sex. Her main drives are to protect the innocent and find her sister. Revenge would also be a plus.
