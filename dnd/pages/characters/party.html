								<p>
									Bud has spent countless centuries drifting between worlds and universes. His history is long, and largely unknown even to him. He is unsure of how old he is, where he came from, and if he ever had a family or a people. Centuries of aimless drifting coupled with rampant use of recreational herbs and mushrooms have severely dulled his long term memory.

									Shamous is an abnormally savage, violent druid. Despite having anger issues and a troubled past, he ultimately has good intentions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Shamous was forever changed the day he saw his village burned to the ground by a rampaging dragon. Finding himself suddenly alone, Shamous wandered the forest seeking purpose. He met another young firbolg survivor, Sonya. They quickly kindled a romance.
								</p>
								<p>
									After several happy years together, Sonya revealed a startling truth. She was the dragon who had razed his childhood home, and chose to take firbolg form afterwards out of guilt. She bore the village no ill-will, but had not yet gained full control over her strength. Shamous was devastated, but chose to forgive Sonya.
								</p>
								<p>
									Eventually, Shamous and Sonya had a child, whom they named Eve. Shamous finally felt at peace. Fate, however, had other plans. Rumors of Sonya's true draconic nature began to spread in the surrounding villages. A mob of panicked villagers attacked during the night. Shamous fought with all his might, but lacked the strength to repel the horde. Once again, he watched as his home and loved ones were burned to the ground.
								</p>
								<p>
									Losing everything twice left Shamous a broken man. He now wanders the world looking for a way to be reunited with his wife and daughter. He will stop at nothing until he achieves this goal.

									WickerBeak is a slightly chaotic, but ultimately good-hearted practitioner of the martial arts.
								</p>
								<p>
									WickerBeak grew up as part of a flock on the streets of Amarillo. Constantly spat upon by society, he and his makeshift family mostly kept to the shadows and stole to keep food on the table.
								</p>
								<p>
									After hearing of an ancient scroll describing kenku flight from before the curse, the flock immediately decided to steal it. The scroll was housed in the council chambers of a cult of powerful sorcerers. This attempted heist failed. Rather than face the music, the flock claimed that it was all WickerBeak's idea. Somehow the sorcerers believed this.
								</p>
								<p>
									WickerBeak was branded a thief and an anarchist and cast out from Amarillo. He wandered the wilderness for what felt like an eternity. Eventually he came upon a secluded monastery. The kindly old master saw goodness in WickerBeak, and allowed him to partake of the monastery's food and shelter. It was here that he began to walk the path of peace. Using his innate ability for mimicry, he was able to learn devastatingly powerful techniques by watching the old master of the monastery. His abilities sparked a great deal of jealousy from the students of the monastery. After being aggressively confronted and threatened by his peers, WickerBeak decided the wisest course of action was to leave his new home before things got out of hand.
								</p>
								<p>
									WickerBeak had been rejected by every family or home he had ever known. Undeterred, he resumed his wandering, hoping to find his place in the world.

								<p>
									Zora Onguh is an exceptional assassin and a woman of few words. Despite her stoicism, she is one of the best allies one could ask for when things hit the fan.
								</p>
								<p>
									Zora spent her early life as a homeless orphan in the seedy underbelly of Aphotia. She was forced to be entirely self-reliant from an early age, and survived only through quick thinking and street smarts. While on the streets, she demonstrated an uncanny gift for stealth and murder. Job options for an underage orphan were limited, so she became an assassin in her early adolescence.
								</p>
								<p>
									Eventually, her work as an assassin caused her to cross paths with a pirate captain named Cross. Cross found her resourcefulness admirable and her plight pitiable. He adopted her and raised her as his own. She became his most trusted lieutenant during his rise to power. As Cross' empire grew, they agreed to keep quiet about their father-daughter bond, so that there was never any doubt that none of Zora's success came from nepotism. Though they downplay their familial bond, Zora continues to be one of Cross' most trusted agents.

								<p>
									Thistlewick is a brash pickpocket who lives by the skin of his teeth, er, beak.
								</p>
								<p>
									Cut-Purse spent most of his life penniless, and turned to a life of petty crime to fill his stomach. Most of the citizens of the capital city were disgusted by his very existence, calling him such crude things as "weather-beaten dung pile", or "wet dog fart". A kindly sky-pirate was moved by his plight, and nicknamed him Thistlewick. The pirate offered him a career as a fellow sky-pirate to fill his stomach and allow him a form of flight.
