							Land Ho (01/13/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Qwot
							S'kra'p'ap
							Thistlewick
							Yoaral

							Six newly minted sky pirates began their training under Captain "Smiley" Kimble:
							<ol>
								<li>Bud the Aasimar (pretty much just a human, but blessed by the gods for one reason or another) Druid</li>
								<li>Namfoodle the Gnome Warlock</li>
								<li>Qwot the Tortle (bootleg Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle) Monk</li>
								<li>S'kra'p'ap the Grung (3' tall poison dart frog person) Sorcerer</li>
								<li>Thistlewick the Kenku (flightless bird-person resembling a raven) Rogue</li>
								<li>Yoaral the Lizardfolk Barbarian</li>
							</ol>

							Captain Smiley chose a nearby skiff for the party's first target. The party boarded the ship with ease, and dealt with each member of the crew onboard. One of the crew members was killed, one captured and fed to the lizardfolk, and the final crew member, a human named Billy, accepted an offer by Namfoodle to join Smiley's crew. They were carrying a letter from the capital city, Amarillo, to the barons of the desert realm. The letter stated that the ruling lords of the kingdom, the Brothers Lim, had gone missing. It also instructed the barons in the desert realm to keep the news quiet to prevent unrest or invasion.

							Captain Smiley's ship was set upon by a much larger, far better armed vessel and boarded. They identified Smiley as captain, killed him, and left after informing the party that the same fate awaited all pirates. During the chaos, Namfoodle and Thistlewick attempted to board and sabotage the enemy vessel. As the hostiles were climbing back onto their ship, Thistlewick used a rowboat to fly to the enemy captain's rope and cut it, sending him plummeting to his death. However, this was witnessed by no fewer than 38 members of the enemy crew, who promptly dispatched the kenku with a hail of arrows. Namfoodle managed to narrowly escape, having fashioned a sort of glider out of canvas bags.

							A brief while after the hostile warship departed, the party began to hear a strange buzzing sound coming from one of their dead captain's pockets. They searched the captain's body, and found that the sound had been coming from a communication crystal, an enchanted gem that allowed verbal communication across vast distances. The buzzing had signaled an incoming communication from the pirate emperor, Cross. He had hoped to speak to Captain Smiley to check on the party's progress. Cross was annoyed to learn of Captain Smiley's death, as he had been the only seasoned sailor onboard. Cross declared the party's training complete, and told them to elect a new captain from amongst themselves to replace Smiley. After a brief deliberation, Namfoodle was chosen.

							Ready to test their strength, they chose a ship of similar power and approached it. After attempts at deceiving the captain of the opposing ship failed, Yoaral took the wheel and rammed the ship. After a somewhat lengthy battle, the party managed to take their prize. Both ships sustained heavy damage in the battle.

							With their newly acquired ship in tow, the party set sail for the only apparent flying landmass. They found it to be about a half-mile in diameter, and covered in the ruins of what appeared to be a harbor village. They saw smoke coming from the other side of the island and decided to investigate, leaving Qwot to guard the ships.

							The exploration party found the source of the smoke to be a campfire outside a secluded hut amid the trees of the island's small forest. This hut appeared to have been partially repaired, and contained a bedroll that was far newer than any of the other furniture. Despite all the signs of recent activity, the party saw no signs of intelligent life.

							Meanwhile, Qwot caught an intruder on their boats, curiously wandering into the captain's cabin. Qwot followed the shadowy figure into the cabin to confront him. From here, he could see the intruder was a bullywug (a 4' frog person). The intruder introduced himself as Smith, a cartographer by trade. He explained that he had discovered the island while working on his latest maps, and had been living there for the last few weeks. The party were the first visitors to the island since he moved in. He agreed to help them repair their ships.


							The Brotherhood (01/27/2018)
							Party:
							WickerBeak
							Yoaral

							The crew were sent on a smuggling mission from Cross to a cold, mountaintop outpost. Being coldblooded, Yoaral was left behind on the island with Smith to avoid freezing. Promising payment in the form of a magic item, Smith sent Yoaral on an assignment of his own to investigate a shadowy new organization known only as "The Brotherhood of Gustav" located outside Amarillo, the capital city.

							The organization operated out of a secluded mansion many miles south of Amarillo in a dense forest. Yoaral took the spare airship and hid it in a small clearing a few miles from the mansion. Upon arriving at the mansion, he bumped into two other adventurers interested in learning more about the inner workings of the cult. The smaller of the two would-be infiltrators was a Kenku known as WickerBeak CrowFist, and the bossier of the two was a human who referred to himself as Matthias, Dark Lord of All.

							The party encountered a number of sentient species wearing deep green cloaks coming and going through the mansion's entryway. After observing the guild members long enough to confidently label them unthreatening, the party entered the mansion through the unlocked front door. Once inside, they were greeted by an overly friendly human receptionist working the front desk. The receptionist proved to be a font of information, but very little of it was useful in determining the function of the guild. In order to obtain the information they needed, it appeared that they would need to meet with the cult leader directly. However, this required reaching a minimum rank within the guild. The party set out to achieve this, gaining several magic items as rewards for reaching certain ranks.

							After being distracted by the magic items, WickerBeak and Yoaral almost entirely forgot to determine whether or not the guild was a danger. They attempted to rank up more rapidly by completing the two highest valued Brotherhood tasks; recruiting a Dryad, and recruiting a speaking carrot. They were able to convince a Dryad to give speech to a carrot, but they were unsuccessful in recruiting the Dryad to the cause (not that they knew what the cause was anyway). The carrot incorrectly identified WickerBeak as his father. WickerBeak named the carrot Pete, shortly before handing him over to the Brotherhood.

							The duo managed to accumulate enough points to allow for themselves and Matthias to meet with Gustav the First. Matthias elected to meet with Gustav the First at a later time. Yoaral and WickerBeak were escorted to a door on the uppermost level of the manor and instructed to enter. The door lead to an atrium that had been converted into a greenhouse. The chamber was overgrown with all manner of flora, but there was not a soul in sight. The party was greeted by an alien voice from within a nearby shrubbery. The shrub was far too small for anyone to hide within.

							It quickly became evident that it was the plant itself that had spoken. It turned to face the adventurers, and introduced itself as Gustav the First. Gustav explained he was once the prized shrubbery of a wealthy, elderly wizard. The empty mansion became too lonely for the wizard, so he cast a spell which granted speech and sentience to Gustav the First. The two shared a wonderful friendship for several years before the wizard died peacefully in his sleep. He left his home and all of his possessions to Gustav.

							While informative, the meeting with Gustav the First was of little use in determining the true intentions of the cult. Yoaral and WickerBeak decided to continue working for the cult a while longer in order to accurately assess whether or not it was dangerous. The duo lingered for another day trying to earn more enchanted trinkets, having unknowingly set events in motion that would allow Matthias to take over The Brotherhood of Gustav.

							During his meeting with Gustav the First, Matthias convinced the shrub to name him as the new cult leader. Matthias renamed the cult the Brotherhood of Matthias, and set about writing new core tenets for the cult. It would take some time to finalize the new tenets, but Matthias explained to the cult members that the humiliation or execution of anyone who called themselves a hero was now their highest priority.

							Matthias awarded Yoaral and WickerBeak the title of "Minion Prime" for their role in his climb to power, and bestowed upon them crimson cloaks with ornate, golden scrolling. Unbeknownst to them, Matthias had placed an enchantment on these that would allow him to know the locations of the cloaks at all times. Matthias gave Yoaral and WickerBeak his blessing to go forth and sow chaos in his name.

							The duo were unsure of the severity of the events that had transpired. Yoaral took WickerBeak aboard the airship and returned to the sky island. After consulting Smith, they decided that the wisest course of action was to leave Matthias be for the time being. While relatively little was actually accomplished, both WickerBeak and Yoaral obtained myriad magical items.


							Invaders (02/10/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							WickerBeak
							Yoaral

							Having completed their mission in the icy mountain region, Namfoodle, S'kra'p'ap, and the rest of their crew set a course for the sky island. They were shocked to find their island under attack from a small party of raiders. While WickerBeak, Yoaral, and Smith held the raiders at bay, the rest of the crew made port and joined the fray. The threat was promptly eliminated by their combined strength. However, the incident gave rise to concerns that the island was no longer safe from passersby. The party took one of the invaders alive and interrogated him. He revealed that he was part of a scouting party sent by the dread Captain Polus, and that the joint forces of Captain Polus and Captain Stor Hattur would invade the island soon.

							Upon hearing this, Smith urged the party to fortify the island. The party split up and descended to the surface world to gather as much aid as possible.

							WickerBeak and Yoaral returned to the former Gustav Manor, where they appealed to their evil overlord, Matthias. They convinced him that Captain Polus was a self-declared hero, and was an endless font of heroic deeds. Matthias was almost immediately triggered, and vowed to destroy Polus with extreme prejudice.

							Namfoodle and S'kra'p'ap elected to pay a visit to Bubble Town, deep within the swamps of the Wetwood. They were uncertain what would await them when they arrived. Bubble Town was very secluded, and had almost no recorded contact with the rest of the world. Namfoodle and S'kra'p'ap found it to be a very primitive, backwards society. They were intercepted at the border by a strangely well-spoken and fashion forward blue-jay Aarakocra.  He offered to help the Party find whatever destination they were looking for, but warned them that he would have to kill them if there was any funny business. The party requested to be led to the ruler, so their new guide/probation officer led them to a makeshift castle within the base of a large tree. The place was ruled by an unidentifiable purple creature, and was populated primarily by Aarakocra, Kenku, Grung, Lizardfolk, Tortle, and several variety of fish people. After winning the ruler's favor with an offering of exotic food, the Bubble Town party was granted 12 green grung, and 3 blue ones with the caveat that they bring back more food from outside the swamps.

							Namfoodle decided to chat up the guide before leaving. He learned that the Aarakocra name was Quintus Skybreeze and that he served as the scout/diplomat for Bubble Town. Quintus' job was to venture into the outside world, and bring any knowledge he gained back to share with his people. After Namfoodle informed him that they live on a floating island, the guide decided to come along out of curiosity.


							Defense of the Island (02/24/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							WickerBeak
							Yoaral

							The party readied their weapons and equipped their new underlings with any spare gear they could scavenge. Having removed the cannons from their ships, they managed to create a makeshift artillery at the edge of the island. Namfoodle used his natural talent for tinkering to create a small stockpile of explosives. Smith provided the heroes with a handful of magical artifacts to aid in their efforts.

							While the battle was difficult, the party and their allies were able to handily defeat the invading force. S'kra'p'ap unleashed powerful magic and made short work of two small battalions, destroying one of them before their ship ever made landfall. Namfoodle commanded the artillery, and managed to dispose of a battalion personally commanded by Captain Stor Hattur. The two Aarakocra present, Urreek and Quintus, were tasked with bombing runs. Yoaral and WickerBeak led a small force to deal with a flanking battalion led by Captain Polus. The duo managed to hold their ground against Polus' henchmen despite being vastly outnumbered. Having finally made the needed travel preparations, Matthias teleported directly behind Yoaral and WickerBeak, and promptly summoned a tornado to sweep Polus and his remaining forces off of the island.

							With the immediate threat dissipated, the party sought ways to benefit from the spoils. Searching the wounded attackers, the party was able to heal and recruit 10 new pirates. They also managed to recruit 14 who attempted to flee the area and capture 1 who refused to join the cause. Many of the enemies' ships had been destroyed or badly damaged during the battle, but the party was able to salvage Captain Polus' flagship.


							Monolith Heist (03/10/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							Yoaral

							Cross contacted Namfoodle and informed him that he had a special assignment for the party. He instructed them to meet a contact in Amarillo who would fill them in on the details, and that their success would determine their position in Cross's empire going forward. Failure would be punished with a painful death, while success would result in compensation and a promotion.

							Upon entering the gates of the capital, the party was approached by a city guard who whispered the phrase "Cog and Sprocket". Yoaral recognized this as the name of a curiosity shop in the commercial district of the city. Entering the store, the party was able to hear the tail-end of a conversation between the shopkeeper and a customer. They didn't catch many details, but they heard something about the Lim Brothers finally holding court again. With their business concluded, the other customer left the store. This meant the only people left in the shop were the party, the shopkeeper, and a shady looking elf.

							The elf revealed himself to be the contact that Cross had told them about. He gave the party what info he could about the secret gambling establishment that Cross needed them to burglarize. The item Cross wanted would be housed inside a safe within a vault. The party would be allowed to keep anything else they found within the vault. Cog, the shopkeeper, quietly pretended not to be paying attention, but S'kra'p'ap' noticed him acting uncomfortable. After Cross's liaison left, the party asked Cog what he knew. After a bit of convincing, he informed the party that they were looking for a casino called The Monolith. He also informed them that this was located in a secret underground city which could only be entered when a code phrase is spoken at a specific door in a specific part of Amarillo.

							The party was able to locate this door and enter with the code phrase. After navigating the supernatural entryway and the city's customs agents, they entered the secret city known as Aphotia. The Monolith was easily the largest building in Aphotia, and was at the very center of the city. After purchasing enchanted goggles for those without darkvision, the party entered The Monolith. The heroes were briefly sidetracked with gambling, which had mostly disastrous results.

							The heroes faced several trials while making their way into the security staircase leading to the vault. They made short work of these, and S'kra'p'ap was able to use bright light to melt through the shadowsteel casing of the vault. The party obtained the safe that Cross required, and stuffed their pockets for good measure. However, the treasure was heavily cursed. Since Yoaral was nominated to be the pack mule, he was hit with the bulk of the curses. While nothing obvious had changed, Yoaral couldn't shake the feeling something terrible awaited him in the near future.

							With the treasure safely in hand, the time had come to make an escape. The party made haste back through the labyrinth of traps and puzzles, and arrived once more at the top floor of the casino. It did not take long for some of the casino guards to notice the thieves. The alarm was promptly raised, and a harrowing chase began. Through a combination of magic, quick thinking, and natural athleticism, the party was able to escape.

							The party rested in an alleyway in Amarillo after narrowly escaping the casino's elite Draugr guard on foot. They decided to take shifts keeping watch, so that no pursuers found them in their sleep. Yoaral fought a losing battle with sleep during his watch. As the lizardfolk began to drift off, the curses imparted to him by the treasure all entered effect. Yoaral began to feel very ill, and then exploded. The blast left scorch marks on the wall he had leaned against, and destroyed most of the treasure in the pack still strapped to his back.

							When morning came, Namfoodle and S'kra'p'ap met with Cross' liaison at Cog and Sprocket. He took the safe and placed it on a table, angling it so that the contents would only be visible to him. Ever curious, Namfoodle quietly snuck close enough to catch a peak of the treasure. The elf opened the safe and inspected its contents. Content with what he saw, the elf handed Namfoodle a small bag of gold pieces and told him to expect further instructions from Cross. The elf then departed with the safe.

							Unlike the elf, Namfoodle found what he had seen inside the safe to be unsettling. It contained not treasure or riches, but the zombified head of the younger of the two Brothers Lim.


							The Fall of Bubbletown (03/24/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							WickerBeak
							Zora Onguh

							Namfoodle and S'kra'p'ap met back up with WickerBeak and Bud at their island base. What remained of the day was quiet and uneventful, for which Namfoodle and S'kra'p'ap were grateful.

							The following morning the party received coordinates from Cross. These led to the current location of the Retaliator, a massive, irregularly designed airship that Cross used as his base of operations. Upon arrival the party was signaled to enter one of the many hangars within the Retaliator. Inside, the party was given a larger ship with far more firepower and an armor-plated hull. The party was assigned a new quartermaster and several new crew members to help operate the more complex vessel. The quartermaster, Zora, was a drow* rogue. Unbeknownst to the rest of the party, Zora was Cross' adopted daughter, and had been planted to serve as a spy reporting directly back to him. She would provide daily reports to keep him up to date on the party's actions.

							The party took some time to introduce themselves to their new quartermaster, and to transfer any important belongings from their previous ship to their new one. The party then departed the hangar and decided to test the might of their ship and crew. They set a course for Bubbletown, and for conquest. Upon arrival at Bubbletown, the party tricked the ruler into climbing into WickerBeak's questionable Bag of Holding*. As soon as the creature was inside, WickerBeak slashed the bag open, trapping the former ruler in another plane of existence.

							Seeing the vacant throne, Bud quickly hatched a plan. He channeled his magic to create give himself a frightful and magnificent appearance, and to make his voice boom and echo. Bud proclaimed himself the new god-king of Bubbletown. The residents of Bubbletown did not know enough of magic to realize that Bud's imposing presence was a mere illusion, and so they took his claims at face value. Bud renamed his new kingdom Budopolis. With Bud's claim to the throne secured, the party set to work recruiting new citizens with which to better fortify their sky island.

							S'kra'p'ap convinced the leader of the Bubbletown Grung to accompany the party back to the sky island, to survey it and see if it would make a suitable new home for his people. He agreed, and selected a few of his favored advisors to accompany him.

							At WickerBeak's request, S'kra'p'ap cast a temporary enchantment upon him, allowing him to fly. WickerBeak demonstrated this flight to the native kenku. WickerBeak then invited the crowd of kenku to join him in founding a monastery so that he could teach them the secrets of flight. Kenku desire flight above all else, and seeing one of their own kind soar the skies was the most miraculous thing they could have ever imagined. They agreed to WickerBeak's terms without a second thought.

							Having successfully thrown the entirety of the newly minted Budopolis into chaos, the party decided to head back to their island home. Bud stayed behind to guide his new subjects.


							Rumblings of Rewera (04/07/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							Zora Onguh

							Upon returning once again to the sky island, the party was greeted by the sounds of progress. Hammers pounded spikes into boards, and saws felled trees to be fashioned into more boards. The party's efforts in renovating the island had finally begun to attract immigrants. The ruins of the ancient village had been restored to livability, and the residents of the island had begun work on expanding their small community. A few shops were already in place, with several other houses and workshops under construction. Before the party could take in the view, they were greeted by Smith.

							Smith informed the party that he had always hated them, and then stabbed S'kra'p'ap. Luckily, S'kra'p'ap's wound was not fatal. The party slew Smith. Upon closer inspection of the body, the party realized this was a doppelganger, a shapeshifting monstrosity, not the bullywug they had come to trust as their advisor. Just as they realized this, Smith walked out of a small nearby hut, removing the last of the rope that had bound him. He thanked the party for dealing with the doppelganger, and then tried to stab Namfoodle. As it turns out, this Smith was also a doppelganger. Namfoodle nimbly dodged the doppelganger's attack while Zora dispatched the creature with a well-placed crossbow bolt.

							Using her highly attuned Drow senses, Zora was able to hear the faint sounds of someone struggling against bonds in one of the more secluded houses. Inside, the party found and disposed of a third Doppelganger. With his dying breath, the doppelganger called out something in the Abyssal tongue, provoking a thunderous noise several miles away. The party freed the captives taken by the doppelgangers (including the real Smith). Smith gave the heroes a handful of magic items as thanks.

							After taking a moment to settle their heads, the party used a spyglass to determine the source of the rumbling. A green dragon was flying straight towards their island home. Taking what little advance warning they had, the party drafted a battle plan. The dragon was swiftly dispatched by the might of their combined forces.

							Before the beast was fully slain, Namfoodle employed a spell to glean some information from the mind of the large reptile. The dragon and the doppelgangers had been sent by something called "Rewera". Namfoodle sensed that the dragon feared the Rewera above all else.

							No one on the island had ever heard of a Rewera. Namfoodle made an executive decision to begin investigating the Rewera, in hopes that it might explain why it had ordered an attack against the sky island.

							Though the party did not know it, one of their new immigrants was a spy sent by the capital city, Amarillo. In the dark of night, they spy quietly sent a raven to Amarillo.


							Dagger in the Dark (05/05/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							Zora Onguh
							Silwerren

							The party kept their ears to the ground for the next few weeks, hoping to hear any mention of the Rewera. While they had no luck obtaining any new information regarding the Rewera, they soon began to hear rumors of a mighty treasure in the southern forests of the Wetwood.

							Namfoodle, S'kra'p'ap, and Zora set out to find this shiny artifact. After circling the forest in their airship for around an hour, they spotted what appeared to be the ruins of an ancient temple. They weighed anchor and disembarked. Inside the temple, they met a tabaxi* rogue named Silwerren. They decided to join forces and explore the ruins together.

							After many hardships and death saving throws, the party managed to locate the treasure chamber within the ruined temple. A golden dagger sat atop an ornate pedestal in the exact center of the room. The pedestal was engraved with ancient text. S'kra'p'ap recognized the language, though the dialect was ancient and difficult to understand. He wisely used paper and charcoal to make an etching of the text to translate in the future.

							Though unsure of its purpose, the party quickly discovered that dagger carried several potent enchantments. Simply touching the dagger with any bit of exposed flesh caused a searing pain, as if the weapon had deemed them unworthy to wield it. They wrapped the dagger in rags and placed it in Namfoodle's pack.

							The party fought their way back out of the temple, and parted ways with Silwerren.

							Once she was confident no one could hear her from her private quarters, Zora made her daily report to Cross. He took particular interest in the dagger, and suggested it was far more valuable than the party realized. He instructed Zora to ensure that the dagger remain safe and accounted for.

							Meanwhile, WickerBeak became bored and turned to drink. He had lost control when drinking from his enchanted flask before, but this time felt different. He became both brilliant purple, and a dryad. He was no longer a flightless, voiceless bird. She was now a champion of nature, complete with a voice all her own. She decided to spend the next few weeks in meditation and come to terms with her new connection to nature.


							Settling In (06/02/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							Zora Onguh

							After returning home and recuperating, the party decided it was time to explore their island more thoroughly. They took some time to become acquainted with their new residents and explore more of the area outside the village.

							Namfoodle gathered two conscripted pirates (Milo and Norilla) and a recent immigrant named Althea (a flora-savvy half-elf), and set out towards the mountain to find a plot to farm. The closer the group came to the mountain, the thicker the forest became. After nearing the base of the mountain, the party was attacked by an Assassin Vine. Namfoodle was entangled and injured by the plant, which would consume him if no intervention occurred. Thinking quickly, Namfoodle called for help with his communication crystal. Milo and Norilla had been conscripted on threat of death, and felt not loyalty to Namfoodle. They panicked and fled back towards town. Althea stood her ground, and was able to dodge the assassin vine's attacks long enough to cut Namfoodle free. Namfoodle and Althea managed to slay the murderous plant. It was about this point that more of the vile vines began to come slowly crawling out of the woodwork.

							Zora decided to ask Smith if he had any older maps of the island. Zora hoped that comparing older maps to the current edge of the island might indicate the rate of expansion. However, Smith was nowhere to be found. His house was vacant, but full of a large number of mysterious arcane artifacts. Shortly after she left the hut, she saw a bright flash of light through one of its windows. She entered the hut again, to find that this time Smith was present. He jokingly chided her for failing to knock, and then asked what he could do for her. Zora asked where he had been a few minutes ago, and Smith replied that he had been taking a nap inside his hut. Zora was positive that was not the case, but received Namfoodle's distress call before she could finish her investigation.

							S'kra'p'ap decided to more closely examine the old monument towards the southwest of the island. Though aged, the large circular platform had clearly once served some magical purpose. S'kra'p'ap rallied a team of grung to clear the debris and foliage from the platform. As more of the structure became visible, S'kra'p'ap noted several magic runes around the circumference of the platform. He was not yet familiar with teleportation magic, but theorized that this was a long-dormant magic teleportation gate. This train of thought was interrupted by Namfoodle's distress call.

							Zora was the first to arrive on the scene to assist Namfoodle. S'kra'p'ap showed up several minutes later, as he had stopped to rally a few trusted allies; Billy, Quintus, Qwot, and WickerBeak. Together they were able to destroy the remaining assassin vines within the forest.

							Althea suggested that the assassin vines did not appear to be native to the area, and that they are often transplanted to keep away unwanted visitors, though she admitted she was not familiar with the ecology of flying landmasses. The party agreed with her assessment, and decided to snoop around the mountain.

							Eventually the party located a cave at the base of the mountain that was protected by a large number of complex magical seals. S'kra'p'ap, being a practiced scholar of the arcane, was able to dispel the seals. Once the last seal was removed, the party cautiously entered the cave.

							The cave-walls were adorned with ancient paintings of strange, snail-like monsters. The cave was suspiciously linear and ended abruptly at a massive door hewn from stone. The party was unable to open the great stone door, but did note large mechanical locks that appeared to accept specific items as keys. Namfoodle noticed that the opening for one of the locks was roughly the appropriate size and shape for the ancient dagger he still carried in his pack. His hunch proved correct. The dagger was a perfect match, however nothing else in the party's belongings was a match for the other locks.   Zora noted that one of the openings appeared to be roughly the correct size and shape for the head of a battle axe.

							Namfoodle still experienced a searing pain anytime he directly handled the dagger, and he had been visibly burnt by it while operating the lock. Zora observed this and suggested she hold on to the dagger for safekeeping. Still in pain, Namfoodle decided that was a wonderful idea. He handed over the dagger without a second thought.

							Unable to proceed any further into the curious structure, the party took etchings of the other keyholes and headed back to town. S'kra'p'ap took great care to recreate the magical seals he dispelled earlier, just in case they served a purpose beyond the party's knowledge.

							Rude Awakening (06/16/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							S'kra'p'ap
							Zora Onguh
							Bud Smoak
							Uriver
							Shamous Northunder
							Arver

							The heroes were awakened early in the morning by the sound of a loud, distorted bell toll. It almost sounded as if the bell were somehow rung in reverse. Alarmed (ba-dum-tss), the party set out to determine its origin. The townsfolk heard no such toll. Just a few moments after beginning their frantic search, Namfoodle, S'kra'p'ap, and Zora saw a ship make port at their island home. Bud Smoke disembarked with a new entourage consisting of Uriver (totally a human), Shamous (firbolg), and Arver (bugbear). They had heard the bell as they were pulling in to port. Perplexed as to why only the seven of them had heard the bell, they were uncertain of what to do. After approximately an hour had passed, the party heard a second, duller bell toll. The party quickly spread out in different directions in an attempt to find the source of the sound.

							While they had no luck locating the origin of the tones, they did discover a glowing, arcane gate atop the monument the grung recently cleared. No sooner had they discovered this oddity than an army of undead creatures began to pour forth from it. The zombies were led by a single curiously dressed goblin riding an equally strange looking flightless bird. The residents of the island quickly mounted a valiant defense.

							The zombies were clumsy and fought poorly, but their sheer numbers made them quite formidable. During this battle, the island began to continuously tremble and shake as if something large were thrashing about within the ground. Shrugging off the unexplained earthquakes, the party decided to focus their attacks on the goblin leading the charge. It was at this point they recognized the goblin as Nilbog, a lesser god of chaos. During this fight, a few of the more perceptive heroes noticed a faint disembodied voice chanting ominous incantations.

							Nilbog lived up to his reputation for comedic violence. He assaulted the party with an evil stand-up routine. His first joke caused several of the heroes to fall to the floor, completely incapacitated by uncontrollable laughter. His next few jokes were so groan-worthy that they caused physical pain for some of the heroes. Satisfied with the audience reception, Nilbog moved in closer and began to beat the incapacitated heroes with his scepter, while holding the other heroes at bay with a continued barrage of terrible jokes. Eventually Namfoodle mustered the willpower to ignore the jokes and properly engage Nilbog. This distracted him long enough for the rest of the heroes to regain their composure. By their combined might, Nilbog was slain.

							Next, the party focused their efforts on the zombies still marching forth from the portal. After a few more minutes of combat, the earthquakes stopped, and a large undead dragon burst forth from the ground chanting terrible incantations. It seemed the invading army was a merely a diversion, meant to allow the dragon to tunnel through the island uninterrupted. It was too late to intervene now. The dragon had won. It uttered the final words of its sinister enchantment, and a concussive blast quickly radiated out from the beast. The party watched helplessly as everything in the path of the blast was vaporized, knowing that they would soon join their allies in the afterlife.

							The bell sounded a third time, and the blast halted mere yards from where the party stood. Time itself seemed to have stopped. The bell sounded once more, but this time it wasn't reversed. Time began to move backwards. The party watched as they helplessly moved in reverse through the previous few hours of their lives. This backwards flow of time grew faster and faster until the heroes could scarcely recognize the events that were un-happening in front them. Bong! The bell rang a second time as time continued to accelerate. Bong! The third and final ring sounded as the flow of time abruptly returned to a normal flow.

							The heroes found themselves exactly where they were at the beginning of the morning. Some unexplained force had granted them a second chance. Knowing exactly what the future held, the party immediately set about taking preventative measures, while listening for the toll of the bell. The toll didn't come. Whatever force had saved the heroes last time had been expended. There would be no do-overs this time.

							Knowing that there was roughly an hour until the arrival of Nilbog and his zombies, the heroes rallied the villagers and had them fortify the area surrounding the gate monument. They entrusted the villagers with repelling the undead horde, and began making preparations for frying a much bigger fish.

							The party divided themselves among their three best armed airships, and filled out the rest of their crews with trusted and experienced allies. Once all three ships were prepared, they flew beneath the island to seek out the dragon. The dragon was an exceptionally large beast, and thus was easily spotted by the trained eyes of Zora. She called out its location and the battle commenced. The dragon proved to be the most frightening foe the heroes had yet encountered. After a harrowing fight the dragon was narrowly destroyed. The heroes suffered heavy casualties, losing several trusted crew members, Billy, and Arver.

							The surviving heroes returned to the surface of the island to aid in the defense of the portal. Upon arrival they found that the battle had already ended. The villagers had successfully slain all the zombies while suffering minimal casualties themselves. However, Nilbog had escaped. When the tides began to turn against him, he fled back into the portal and closed it behind him.

							Smith provided the heroes with several magic items as a gift for defending the island. The heroes were uncertain where he kept getting so many rare artifacts, but had no intentions of turning down free loot.


							Quid Pro Quo (08/04/2018)
							Party:
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Uriver

							A courier came to the sky island bearing a letter from the capital city.

							Namfoodle was both concerned and intrigued. He had seen the zombified head of Pehr Lim inside a safe, so who or what sent this letter?

							Namfoodle and Uriver decided to attend court as representatives of their crew and made haste for the court of Amarillo. They were escorted to the throne room to meet with the Brothers Lim. Inside, they saw what were unmistakably both Pehr and Osbeck Lim sitting upon their thrones alive and well.

							Pehr Lim did most of the talking, and explained that he was prepared to officially declare the party as privateers in service to the crown. He would also outfit the flying island with munitions, fortifications, and a garrison of soldiers to report directly to Namfoodle and any officers he designated. However, he required that the pirates perform a small task to prove themselves competent enough to be associated with Amarillo. An otherworldly monster had recently begun to stalk the streets at night, eating people foolish enough to be out after dark. Pehr Lim explained that if the party were to deal with this creature he would consider it proof that they were worthy of royal commission.

							The party noted that Pehr Lim had a strangely loose grasp on the common tongue and possessed a very thick accent. They also noted that Osbeck Lim remained completely silent, instead content to simply stand menacingly with his beloved war hammer strapped to his back. Despite this, the party found the terms agreeable, and set out to locate and eliminate the monster.

							It was early afternoon when the meeting with the Lims ended. The party decided to use the remaining daylight hours to ask around about monster sightings. They learned that the monster was most active in the slums in the southeast of the city. Curiously, it seemed to avoid preying on the large number of homeless people in the neighborhood. They were unable to get a consistent description of the creature. Some witnesses described it as a large scurrying creature with 4 legs, while others insisted that it was a bipedal creature roughly the size of an average human.

							As evening grew closer the party concluded their initial investigation and chose a location to stakeout based on their findings. Unfortunately, the winding alleys and tightly-packed shacks of the slums did not allow for much in the way of visibility. Despite this, their labor bore fruit surprisingly quickly. The party spotted what appeared be a rat the size of a horse fleeing a nearby alleyway. The party quickly gave chase, making a point to glance into the alley the rat had fled. Unsurprisingly, it contained what little remained of the creature's latest victim.

							The chase was very brief. The rat kept to the shadiest alleyways it could find and began to twist and contort. In a matter of seconds, it had become a nightmarish bipedal rat-creature wearing, and seconds after that it appeared completely human. Based on this, the party correctly identified the creature as a wererat. It continued to lead the party on a winding chase through the narrow alleyways, and managed to leave their line of sight. Luckily, the dusty alleyways showed the creature's footprints clearly enough for the party to continue to give chase. However, the footprints abruptly ended in an alleyway full of homeless people.

							Unbeknownst to the party, the vile rodent had chosen to blend in with the dozen or so homeless people in the alley. With no more footprints to follow, the party slowed down as they continued out the other end of the alley. This allowed the wererat to get a good look at the party, and he promptly decided to take the opportunity to strike. He attempted to sneak up behind the party and shank Namfoodle, but Uriver heard his approach in time to stop him. She restrained the wererat, and the party quickly shuffled him away somewhere more private to interrogate the creature.

							After a mild bit of torture, the wererat became pretty talkative. He explained that he was a bounty hunter, and recently began operating in the Amarillo, as it was the last known location of his current targets. Glaumgogh, the owner of the Monolith, had placed a hefty bounty on the heads of Namfoodle, Yoaral, and S'kra'p'ap. Namfoodle was understandably distressed to learn about these bounties. The wererat sensed that Namfoodle was distracted by this news, and decided this was his opportunity to turn the tables. He shifted back to the form of a giant rat and attacked. This did not go the way he had hoped.

							The party returned to the palace with the severed head of the wererat in tow. Pehr Lim was pleased with this, and had one of his aides bring the severed head to the court mages for use in their alchemical studies. He delivered his terms to the party. The party would be allowed to keep any wealth they plundered in its entirety, but would be required to refrain from raiding any vessels belonging to Amarillo. They would also have to renounce the pirate lord Cross. Pehr went on to explain that Cross had recently taken to relentless blackmail and slander, and had become a thorn in his side.

							Namfoodle explained that his crew was something of a democracy, and that he would prefer to discuss the terms with his crewmates before making a final decision. The Lims agreed to allow the party to return to the sky island to think things over.


							Information, Technology (08/11/2018)
							Party:
							Zora Onguh

							Zora answered a summons from Cross to discuss a matter too sensitive for communication crystals. She took an airship and a small crew and set a course for the Retaliator (Cross' massive airship).

							Cross wished to see the dagger she carried. After closer inspection of the weapon, he praised Zora for her success. He explained that it was part of a set of weapons with unique properties, meant for killing the ultimate prey. Cross further explained that he had big plans for this set of weapons, and intended to outfit a handful of his most trusted lieutenants with them when the time was right. He returned the dagger to Zora, and told her to hang onto it so she would be ready once the time had come. He tasked her with keeping an eye out for the rest of the set.

							As a reward for her exceptional work in obtaining the dagger, Cross presented Zora with a new type of weapon. He explained that the boys in the lab had worked out a way of making cannons small enough to fit in a person's hand, and they called this new weapon a flintlock.

							Cross reminded Zora that she was not to breathe a word to anyone concerning the ancient weapon set. If anyone asked why he had summoned her, it was only to equip her with a flintlock so that she could field test the new technology.


							The Interrogation of Nilbog (08/25/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Shamous Northunder
							S'kra'p'ap
							Uriver
							Zora Onguh

							Once again, a courier from Amarillo arrived carrying a letter from the Brothers Lim.

							Quicheday was in fact not a sacred tradition, as there had never been one before. The party set a course for Amarillo to observe this new holiday. Upon their arrival at Amarillo, the party was met by the sights and sounds of a lively festival. The party paused to enjoy the festivities for a while. Once they were content, they made their way to the palace to meet once more with the Brothers Lim.

							Pehr Lim greeted them jovially, and insisted they all partake of the royal quiche. Once the quiche was finished, Pehr lightly chided the heroes for taking so long to accept his generous offer of the status of privateer. As a gesture of goodwill, he had prepared a special gift for the heroes. A little birdy had told him all the messy details about the recent zombie invasion on the sky island. Pehr Lim's gift to the party was Nilbog. He was being held in the dungeon below the castle. Pehr permitted the party to enter the dungeon, and invited them to question Nilbog as long and as violently as they wished.

							In light of this gift, the party agreed to the Lims' terms. The party gleefully accepted the offer to "chat" with Nilbog, and made way for the dungeon at once. They interrogated Nilbog quite thoroughly. Nilbog initially remained tight-lipped, and was clearly frightened of what would happen to him if he were to divulge any information. Eventually, he gave in to the party's methods, and informed them that he had been sent to the sky island on orders from Rewera. Nilbog explained that Rewera intended to become a god, and that this somehow involved the set of magical weapons to which the dagger belonged.

							Nilbog provided the party with his 'Shopping list': a piece of parchment which had the teleportation circle runes for 7 locations, with 2 of them already crossed out. He informed the heroes that each location contained an important item from the same set as their dagger, but that he did not know which item was in which location.

							Nilbog gave the heroes any other information that he could, but asked that they leave him in his cell. A war was coming, with stakes higher than any before it. After the battle on the sky island, Nilbog was convinced he'd end up dead regardless of which side he chose. He wanted to stay as far away from the coming war as possible, and he had decided his cell felt pretty remote.

							With their newfound knowledge, the party decided to try the first two (crossed out) locations on the list. Luckily, S'kra'p'ap had recently mastered the use of teleportation gates, and was able to use magic powerful enough to allow the entire party to travel together.

							The first set of runes on the list brought the party to Aphotia, where Namfoodle panicked and convinced the party to try the next location. Though his magic was nearly drained, S'kra'p'ap was able to muster enough power to travel one last time.

							This time the party found themselves on the top of the northern mountains in the middle of a blizzard. Visibility was incredibly low, but the party was able to make out a large cave opening nearby. They entered the cave and found that it led to an ancient temple, similar to the one they had explored in the Wetwood. The party decided to explore the temple. It was heavily laden with traps, and littered with the recently slain corpses of frost giants who had failed to repel Rewera's forces. The party determined that Rewera had already removed anything of value from the temple. With nothing left to find in the temple, the party retreated to the relative safety of the entry chamber. S'kra'p'ap had expended too much of his magic power to teleport again, so the party was forced to camp in the temple for the night.

							The blizzard eased up during the night, allowing for much greater visibility the following morning. This allowed the party to determine that their current location was somewhere in the Moonfire Mountains, at the northern peak of the continent of Lagos.

							The night of rest restored S'kra'p'ap's magic energy. He channeled some of his renewed power to safely whisk the party back to their island in the sky.


							The Firelake (09/08/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Shamous Northunder
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Rynn
							Uriver
							Zora Onguh

							An air genasi historian named Redji Cloudtaker came to the island. He had spent years studying an ancient set of arcane weapons, and had followed a lead to the sky island. The party deemed the historian trustworthy after a healthy round of questioning. Namfoodle shared most of the information that the party had learned about the weapon set, and Redji joined the party.

							Over the last few months, many grung had relocated to the Sky Island. S'kra'p'ap decided to take a step back from the role of active adventurer to better serve and guide his people.

							Bud received a letter from someone named Salax who claimed to be a friend. The letter stated that the time had come for them to talk, and asked Bud to visit Salax in the desert city of Wustebie. Not interested in being lured to some remote corner of the world to be assassinated, Bud gathered the party and Rynn, a warrior for hire before setting a course for Wustebie.

							The heroes located Wustebie with little trouble. They knew nothing of the city except the name and the location, but a quick glance proved more than enough to get a feel for the place. Wustebie was a small village, seemingly inhabited only by kobolds. The party disembarked just outside of the village, and made their way towards the center of town. They were greeted in broken common by a friendly kobold. The rest of the villagers were more skittish and kept their distance from the party. The party asked the kobold where they might find Salax. The friendly local led the heroes to Salax's house. He explained that Salax was the village elder, and functioned like sort of an unofficial mayor. The party parted ways with their guide and entered Salax's home.

							Salax welcomed the party into his home, and asked them to wait in the living area while he prepared some tea. The party's initial impression of Salax was a curiously refined, well-spoken elderly kobold with light silver scales. He returned a few moments later. After pouring himself and any interested heroes a cup of hot tea, he began to question the party under the guise of small talk. The conversation had been a thinly veiled way to assess the moral fiber of the heroes, and the old kobold seemed eerily perceptive. It quickly became evident that he had a strong disdain for Namfoodle, Uriver, and Zora. He also seemed to dislike Redji, though not as strongly.

							After a brief pause in the conversation, the silver kobold asked Bud how much he knew of his heritage. Bud informed Salax that he had never known his parents or his homeland. He had spent the centuries of his life as a wanderer, in search of purpose. Salax paused for a moment to sip his tea. Bud began to hear Salax's voice directly in his mind. He asked Bud how thoroughly he trusted his traveling companions. Salax explained that he had contacted Bud to share some very sensitive information, and that it would be disastrous if this information found its way to people with evil souls. Bud thought back that he would trust any one of his companions with his life. Satisfied, Salax told the party a tale from an age long past.

								"Millennia ago, sages from each civilized race met to discuss what would happen if the gods ever turned against mortals. Fearing for the apocalypse such an event would bring, they commissioned a series of twelve enchanted weapons that could, in theory, kill a god. These instruments of death were called Godfall, after the tribunal that commissioned them.
								"Unbeknownst to the sages, the blacksmith's apprentice created a series of amulets that would absorb the essence of any deity slain with a Godfall weapon. This essence could be used by a mortal to attain godhood. Within a few days, the apprentice's creations were discovered. The sages became terrified that this would provoke the wrath of the gods. In an effort to appease the immortals, the sages banished the apprentice from this plane of existence, and stamped upon the young man the cursed title of 'Rewera'.
								"The blasphemous weight of what had been done was not lost on the sages. They separated the weapons, and distributed them to the known cultures for safekeeping. Any of these weapons is capable of killing a deity, but possessing the entire collection would allow up to a dozen warriors to raise arms against a god. If those same warriors were to be outfitted with the Rewera Amulets, the entire pantheon could be usurped."

							The heroes got the impression the strange little kobold knew more than he was letting on, but they were unable to convince him to divulge any further information.

							Salax politely explained to the party that he wished to speak to Bud alone for a time, and asked them to wait outside. Once everyone except Bud had left Salax's home, he began to speak once more of events from ages past. He revealed that Bud was the last surviving member of the Dewis, an ancient lineage that had sworn to serve the forces of good, and to oppose the Rewera if he ever returned. With his people all but extinct, that responsibility now fell to Bud.

							Salax wished Bud luck, and suggested that he seek out the remaining weapons before Rewera could obtain them. The party purchased some supplies and boarded their airship. The heroes examined their maps looking for likely hiding places for the remaining weapons. After some consideration, the party decided that the most obvious candidate was The Firelake, a massive volcano to the northwest of the continent of Lagos. They set a course accordingly.

							During the flight, the heroes witnessed Smith walk out of the door to the captain's cabin carrying a large canvas sack, despite not having been onboard the ship just a few minutes ago. He glanced around the deck, appeared confused, and walked back through the door. The party followed, and saw that he was nowhere to be found. The heroes contacted him through a communication crystal they had given him previously. Smith insisted that he was sitting inside his house, and suggested that the party was simply hallucinating. The party continued to press him, and he admitted that he had made an error in a teleportation spell.

							The heroes reached The Firelake. They disembarked, but were quickly set upon and captured by the local firenewts. Bud and Shamous were able to use their druidic powers to transform into flying insects and escape. The rest of the party was carried inside the volcano and placed into cages.

							Rynn managed to pick the lock on his cage, but his escape was quickly halted by one of the higher ranking newts guarding the cages. After unceremoniously throwing Rynn back in his cell, the newt began to hiss something in Ignan, the language of fire. Luckily, Namfoodle and Redji were able to speak Ignan, and translated for Rynn. The newt liked Rynn's moxie, and demanded that Rynn invoke the Rite of Challenge so that the newt could slay him in the combat pools. Rynn agreed. Namfoodle cast the spell Comprehend Languages on Rynn, allowing him to understand (but not speak) Ignan for the next hour. Redji relayed Rynn's agreement to the firenewt.

							The newt that had challenged Rynn was impressed with his courage, and began to treat him with the respect he felt was due any warrior. The firenewt opened Rynn's cage and led him deeper inside the volcano. He showed Rynn to a weapons rack, and motioned for him to choose whatever he wanted. Once Rynn had selected a weapon, the newt led him to a large, roughly circular pit that was partially filled with lava. A crowd of firenewts had already begun to gather around the pit, eager to watch the fight unfold. One of these wore a decorated skull as a mask, and seemed to be the referee for the coming fight. The firenewt that had challenged Rynn walked to the opposite side of the pit, and leapt down into it. He gestured for Rynn to follow suit.

							Back at the cage, Redji asked the nearest guard what was to become of the party. The newt explained that the party was to be prepared and eaten as a banquet in honor of their deity, Ghoyzhu. Upon learning of their intended fate, Redji quickly prepared and cast a spell that allowed him and up to three allies to teleport to a nearby location. He used this to bring himself, Namfoodle, Uriver, and Zora back to the airship.

							Rynn cast a spell that would allow him to hover for roughly ten minutes. He descended into the pit with his opponent, being careful to float a few inches above the top of the lava. The crowd loudly hissed their disapproval of this magical trick, but did nothing to intervene. The fight was brief. Rynn was an experienced warrior, and was far beyond the abilities of the firenewt. He slayed the firenewt warrior, and hovered back out of the pit. The referee met him and burned his handprint into Rynn's cuirass, but not before berating him for using cowardly magic. The handprint on his cuirass marked Rynn as a free man, and guaranteed him safe passage back out of the volcano.

							Rynn decided to use his visitor's pass to poke around a bit before leaving. He discovered that the newts had three primary pillars of society; combat, music, and storytelling. He approached a group of firenewts playing music and attempted to join in by performing his rendition of Guchi Gang. He then proceeded to roll a natural 20 on his performance check, tragically causing trap music to become a sensation.

							Having successfully escaped with their lives, the party decided to quit while they were ahead. They set a course for the sky island to recuperate. Zora allowed Redji to borrow the dagger, in the hopes that his studies would lead her to more of the set.


							Calm Before the Storm (10/06/2018)
							Party:
							Uriver
							Rynn

							The party returned to Wustebie to seek assistance from Salax. After a great deal of convincing, he agreed to use magic to attempt to divine the location of another Godfall weapon. This led the party to the city of Elmusk, far to the south.

							Elmusk wasn't much to look at. It was a rather small village, with ramshackle buildings radiating outward from a dilapidated tower. The party asked around to see if anyone knew of an ancient relic nearby. None of the locals were aware of such an artifact, but they suggested the party try the strange old wizard living in the tower.

							There was no response when the party knocked on the door to the tower. After waiting long enough that it didn't feel rude, they opened the door. The only apparent resident of the tower was entropy. The interior was ruined from centuries of disrepair, and there was no sign of anyone living here. The party decided to stake out Elmusk for one more day.

							The following morning the party spotted a loudly dressed, elderly gnome wandering about the village, systematically petting every visible fuzzy animal. The party approached the gnome and asked if he knew anything about the Godfall weapons. The clearly senile gnome introduced himself as "The Right Honorable Royal Highness Emperor Princess Jeeb the Wise, First of His Name, Rocker of Parties, Petter of Small Mammals, and Generally Good Guy", and stated that it's difficult to remember what one knows when one is as old as he was. He invited the party into the tower.

							When Jeeb opened the door it led to a comfortable (albeit strangely decorated) room. The room was a perfect circle and had two identical doors. He led the party through 3 more rooms, which were identical in all but their contents. Finally, they arrived at a 5th room. This room had only one door, with a large mirror hanging from the wall where the second door had been in all of the previous rooms.

							The gnome muttered an incantation under his breath. The party recognized the spell as Detect Good and Evil, a spell used to determine whether a person is virtuous, vile, or somewhere in-between. Jeeb's demeanor shifted as he approached the mirror. For the first time since the party met him, the jovial old gnome sounded serious, perhaps even melancholy.  He asked the party to gaze into the mirror with him, and tell him what they saw.

							When Rynn gazed into the mirror, he felt the world shift around him. By the time he caught his balance he was standing in an entirely new room. This one shared the same circular layout as the others, but contained no doors. It was sparsely decorated, containing only a hanging mirror and a dusty wooden case atop a rickety table. He cautiously opened the case, and found that it contained an ancient wand bearing the same motif as the Godfall dagger. Rynn carefully collected the wand and then gazed into the mirror. He felt the world shift once more under his feet, and found himself standing beside Jeeb in the previous room.

							Uriver had a rather different experience with the mirror. She too felt the world shift around her. However, when she caught her balance she found herself alone in the same room. That wasn't quite right though. The room had flipped itself. Right had become left, and left had become right. Puzzled, she looked around for a moment before being struck by a startling realization. She no longer had a reflection in the mirror. Jeeb certainly did though. Jeeb stood in the mirror, visibly chuckling to himself. Understandably concerned, she tried to leave through the door behind her. It led only to a flat image of the previous room. She had become trapped in the mirror.

							Shortly after returning to the room with Jeeb, Rynn noticed that the only sign of Uriver was her reflection, angrily screaming at Jeeb. Rynn asked Jeeb what had happened to his traveling companion. Jeeb explained that his magic had shown him that Uriver had an evil heart, and could not be trusted with such an important artifact. Rynn explained that he disagreed with the elderly gnome's assessment. Uriver was far from a saint, but she had demonstrated a capacity for heroism on occasion. However, Jeeb was still not convinced. Rynn proposed that Uriver be set free on the condition that he be held responsible if she caused any harm. Jeeb agreed, but with one additional agreement. He wanted to add Rynn's name to his collection. The now nameless hero agreed, and "The Right Honorable Royal Highness Emperor Princess Jeeb Rynn the Wise, First of His Name, Rocker of Parties, Petter of Small Mammals, and Generally Good Guy" freed Uriver from the mirror.

							On the voyage back to the sky isle, the party witnessed massive bolt of lightning strike near Tordanei's temple in Graisham, immediately followed by the appearance of a nasty storm. The party theorized that this could be one of Tordanei's infrequent visits to her temple there. The hero formerly known as Rynn decided it was high time the party talked to a god about the god-killing weapons they'd been finding, and so the party weighed anchor nearby. The party's theory was correct. Tordanei and her entourage of demigods had stopped in to create a storm to keep her sister Graisum's favorite plants healthy.

							Tordanei and her entourage had already settled in and burned through a couple of kegs of ale in the few minutes it took the party to arrive at the temple. Luckily, the goddess of storms was a happy drunk, and was pleased to see mortals with the courage to approach her. Since she was in a good mood, she waived the traditional "instant but painful death" that was usually administered as punishment for entering the temple's sacred grounds.

							The hero formerly known as Rynn asked if Tordanei was aware of the Godfall weapons. She was not, and was initially very dismissive that such a thing could even exist. Taking extreme care not to seem hostile, Rynn unsheathed the Godfall wand and showed it to Tordanei. After a brief inspection of the weapon and a more thorough explanation from Rynn, Tordanei decided that there may have been some merit to his claims. Rynn also told her about Zora and the Godfall dagger she carries. Tordanei thanked them for the information, and then took her leave.

							The party decided to avoid the sky island in light of the fact that they had just told a prime deity that it held a weapon designed to kill her. The party changed course for Amarillo instead. Here, they dispelled the magical disguises on the Brothers Lim, revealing them to be a goblin and an ogre. After this, they made some rudimentary newspapers with the text 'Pehr Lim is a goblin' and air dropped them into Amarillo. Accidentally killed a merchant by dropping a bundle of newspapers onto his head from the sky.

							Having killed some time, the party returned to the Sky Isle only to find Tordanei had decided to pay Zora a visit.


							Trial of the Seekers (10/20/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Shamous Northunder
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Uriver
							Zora Onguh

							After confirming that Zora did not have the Godfall dagger (she had recently loaned it to Redji), Tordanei left the sky island. She stated that she would be back, but she needed to consult someone. Upon hearing this, Redji panicked. He teleported to Amarillo and frantically hid the dagger underneath a loose paving stone on a relatively low-traffic street.

							Meanwhile Larazi, the goddess of law, had begun to round up all the party members on the sky island and teleport them to a council chamber on a different plane. Realizing that one was missing, she traced Redji to Amarillo and brought him along too.

							The party was reunited in the council chamber to stand trial for collecting the Godfall artifacts. The twelve gods of the prime pantheon were to be the judges, and each would cast a vote for the innocence or guilt of each party member. Each party member would have a chance to make their case to the gods, and be questioned by the gods.

							Bud was smitten with Tordanei, and attempted to make an impression on her during his trial. Surprisingly, he succeeded in this. Unfortunately, nobody within the party managed to sway enough of the gods to avoid punishment. Each party member was assigned to a different demigod (chosen at random) to be sentenced. The severity of these punishments varied based upon how many guilty votes the party member received, as well as the disposition of the demigod assigned to decide their sentence.

								• Bud was sentenced by Kragene, demigod of commerce. He received a stern talking-to and a small fine.
								• Namfoodle was sentenced by Enamela, demigod of tooth fairies. He had all of his top teeth removed.
								• Redji was sentenced by Veland, gob of goblins. He was made to bow before Veland, and was forced to take on an immortal goblin ward, Thunder.
								• Shamous was sentenced by Captain Chad, demigod of piracy. He was banished to the bottom of the sea.
								• Uriver was sentenced by Benterton, demigod of bad days. She was placed atop a tower of glass, which was then shattered by Benterton.
								• Zora was sentenced by Doujien, the sultan of smiles. Doujien thought Zora's cold façade impeded her happiness, and sentenced her to "lighten up".

							The party was given a few moments to make peace with each other and any gods they chose before their sentences were carried out. During this allotted time, some of the party members received small gifts from gods or demigods that believed in their innocence.

								• Bud received a keg golem (a walking barrel of ale that magically never empties) and a note with a winking face drawn on it from Tordanei, goddess of storms.
								• Namfoodle received schematics for modified modrons and two modron power cores from Rachi, goddess of invention.
								• Redji received a vague map and some notes from Notriv, goddess of wisdom and knowledge. These will eventually lead to his father.
								• Shamous received a leather satchel containing 4 varieties of beans and a dead angler fish from Graisum, goddess of the harvest.
								• Uriver received bladed boomerangs and an enchanted dark ruby ring from Mortadus, god of war.
								• Zora received a magical locket and a pocket watch from Doujien.

							Benterton conjured a massive tower made of glass and placed Uriver at the very top. He then shattered the glass. Between the fall and the shards of glass, Uriver was left very worse for wear.

							Shamous was teleported to the bottom of the ocean. Thankfully, there was a slim chance that he might survive. Shamous was a powerful druid, and experienced druids could take the form of animals they had seen firsthand. Since he had seen the angler fish Graisum had gifted him, he was able to take its form. This prevented him from drowning or being crushed by the extreme pressure. Using his ability to assume the shape of wildlife, Shamous slowly swam to the surface. Luckily, he surfaced near an island. He swam ashore. The only thing he could see on the island was very thick forest, so he decided to venture into the wood.


							Rise of Rewera (11/03/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Shamous Northunder
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Uriver
							Zora Onguh

							There are those who say the wheels of fate are above question, and are fair rulers of our destinies. Those people are fools. In perhaps the most severe recorded case of circumstantial evidence, the party had barely been released from their trial when the unthinkable happened. Immordan, god of death, was slain in his domain.

							The gods and demigods had all been present at the trial of the seekers. This provided an opportunity for Rewera to infiltrate the underworld and set a trap. He lay in wait for Immordan, god of death, to return. Using an amulet of his own design, Rewera absorbed the essence of Immordan and became the new god of death.

							This shift in the balance of the universe was immediately felt by the other prime deities. Predictably, they did not take this lightly. None of the gods are without flaw, regardless of the purity of their intentions.

							Larazi's flaws revealed themselves in great and terrible fashion. Enraged at the loss of her brother, and in fear for her own life, she traveled to the location of the only people she knew had carried the weapons capable of such an atrocity. She cast aside all pretense of justice, and slew every living being on the sky island in cold blood.

							Shamous wandered into secret city of Thistleton. The Grippli residents initially hid and watched him from the treetops, but Shamous felt their eyes upon him. He called out to them and assured them that he meant them no harm. One of the Grippli, named Ribbert, talked with Shamous and offered him directions to the nearest port. Following these directions, Shamous began to head south. However, he managed to travel only a little over a mile before tragedy struck. He was intercepted and executed by a horde of Grippli warriors led by the demigod Gillywung, sent on orders from Larazi.

							Thanks to their nearly simultaneous executions, the party was reunited in the underworld. Here they did some stuff and got into some mischief, before ultimately being selected to become some of the first members of the Rewera's undead army.

							They were thrust back into their bodies, and Shamous body had conveniently been moved the island by magical means. Namfoodle and Redji were able to temporarily resist the Rewera's influence. The other party members did not fare so well. They began to walk towards the mountain on the Sky Isle, with the intention of retrieving whatever lay within.

							The party was intercepted by Nilbog, who used his beguiling influence to temporarily block the Rewera's influence from the party's minds. He informed them that he could restore two of them to life by feeding them phoenix blossoms, and that this would completely remove the Rewera's influence from their minds. However, the other four would have to be slain, and their bodies burnt to prevent the Rewera resurrecting them again.

							Bud informed everyone that he had the ability to reincarnate the recently deceased in a new random body, and asked Nilbog if this would have a similar effect. Nilbog agreed that it would most likely break the telepathic link with the Rewera. Bud had enough magical energy to reincarnate two people, bringing the total number of heroes who could be saved to four. This meant that two party members would still have to die.

							Nilbog's beguiling influence would only be able to buy the party so much time before the Rewera reasserted his control over their minds. They used this time to quickly debate about who should be saved, neglecting to consider that the chaotic Nilbog might not play along.

							Bud was obvious, as his reincarnation spells took a longer to cast than Nilbog's interference allowed. They would use one of Nilbog's proper resurrections on Bud so that Bud could use his reincarnations on two others. Nilbog agreed that this made sense, and restored Bud to life. This left enough resources for three more heroes to be saved.

							In a surprising show of selflessness, Uriver volunteered to remain dead. This left four candidates for the three remaining positions.

							Redji made it clear that he wished to live, and had no intentions of giving up his status as an air genasi. He wanted the remaining resurrection, not one of the reincarnations.

							Namfoodle and Shamous both wanted to live, but were okay with being restored in new bodies. They were willing to settle for reincarnation.

							In yet another unprompted selfless act, Zora decided to remove herself from the equation. She drew the flintlock that her adopted father had once gifted her, placed it at her temple, and pulled the trigger. Unfortunately, this was hilarious to Nilbog's wicked sense of humor. Thinking this some incredibly clever joke, he immediately decided to begin feeding his remaining phoenix essence to Zora.

							In a panic, Redji pushed the tiny demigod aside. He took the phoenix essence from Zora's deceased mouth, and swallowed it himself.

							With time running out, Bud decided to respect Zora's wishes. He used his two reincarnations on Namfoodle and Shamous. Namfoodle became a tiefling, while Shamous became a protector aasimar.

							Nilbog stressed that he did not want anyone to know of his intervention, and that he intended to retreat into exile. Desperate to hide from the wrath of the Rewera, Nilbog fled the island.

							The party took a brief moment to mourn their fallen comrades. After collecting any useful items, the surviving party members constructed funeral pyres and cremated Uriver and Zora. They collected ashes from each in case they found a way to rescue their souls from the Rewera.

							They also decided to burn the bodies of the fallen citizens of the island, to prevent the Rewera from having easy access to a zombie army in the sky. Redji collected S'kra'p'ap's and Zora's notes. Unsurprisingly, Smith did not appear to have been on the island at the time of massacre, as his body was nowhere to be found.

							The party made haste towards Amarillo. Making their way to the slums, Redji checked the hiding place where he left the Godfall Dagger. Unfortunately, it was nowhere to be found. They didn't know it yet, but it had fallen into the hands of Amarillo's newest crime boss…


							Birth of the Resistance (11/17/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Shamous Northunder

							The surviving members of the party scarcely had time to process the disappearance of the dagger before they were interrupted by a child dressed in rags. The child delivered the party a small scroll and left without a word. The scroll had originated from the Cog, proprietor of Cog and Sprocket, and asked the heroes to make their way his store as soon possible.

							The heroes obliged. Cog confirmed that the heroes had not brought any unwanted plus ones. Once he was satisfied that only the desired attendees were present, Cog closed up shop and locked the door. He led the heroes into his dimly-lit storeroom, where a heavily armored aasimar man sat at a roughhewn round table.

							The man introduced himself as Falimur, a cleric who, unlike most, served not the will of a single deity, but the will of the greater pantheon. In the brief time since the Rewera usurped the throne of death, the state of the world had decayed substantially. The dead were rising unprompted from their graves to wreak havoc on the living. Magic that the clergy employed to restore life to the recently deceased was failing with increasing frequency. This turn of events seemed to foretell a very dark future for the living. If Falimur's hypothesis was correct, it was only a short matter of time before life was extinguished from the world.

							This secret meeting was to be the birth of the resistance. Falimur would provide a mouthpiece for the gods and work to ensure that the party did not fall victim to further outbursts from the divines. Cog would provide what equipment and what support he could to the heroes. Having witnessed firsthand the seriousness of recent events, the other heroes agreed to stand against the Rewera.

							Cog noticed that the party had fewer members than the last time they stopped by to upgrade their gear. He approached an eerily lifelike steel statue of a winged young elven woman. The shopkeeper drew a device from his belt. With a peculiar hint of melancholy, he touched it to the statue. Steel turned to flesh as the elf fell to the floor. Cog calmly explained to the groggy elf that she had been trapped in the statue for a long time, though he was unsure exactly how long. He had reason to believe that she had once been a hero and a great warrior. After being brought up to speed on the situation, woman introduced herself as Jasper Nightbreeze, and agreed to join the resistance.

							Cog allowed the members of the newly formed resistance to take what they needed (within reason) from his shop's inventory. As always, everything in the store had been crafted or customized by Cog.

							The resistance had managed to determine rough locations for two of the Godfall weapons. One was located somewhere in the palace of Amarillo, while the other was being sold to an unknown collector. The party wisely elected to follow the transaction first, to prevent the weapon from falling into the wrong hands.

							The heroes were able to track the transaction to Aphotia. Luckily, Namfoodle's reincarnation left him unrecognizable. Between Namfoodle's new body and untimely deaths of S'kra'p'ap and Yoaral, the party no longer had to worry about the bounty issued by Glaumgogh. The party had learned during their previous visit that The Monolith was a popular hangout for organized crime. The heroes correctly judged this to be the most likely meeting place for the transaction, and made their way inside the seedy casino. There they found Cross' fence, Herzog Meier, delivering a hefty payment to a group of mobsters.

							The heroes managed to inconspicuously draw near enough to the transaction to eavesdrop. They only managed to catch a small amount of the brief conversation, but it was enough to formulate a plan of action. The dagger would be delivered to Cross' forces the following morning, in a field miles south of Amarillo.

							The party waited for Herzog to leave, and then promptly eliminated the mobsters and relieved them of their money. Namfoodle and Redji departed with the money for safekeeping.

							Bud, Falimur, Shamous, and Jasper soldiered on. They spent the night in the forest south of Amarillo so as to have a head start on the thugs that would be delivering the dagger. This paid off spectacularly. Shamous spotted the convoy during his watch. They heroes managed to intercept the convoy during the dark hours of the morning before it reached the rendezvous point.

							Bud transformed into a giant eagle and swooped down upon the thugs as if he were the embodiment of wrath. Shamous transformed into a mighty dire stag and gored many thugs upon his massive horns. Jasper rode atop the stag and destroyed the wagons with her flaming sword. Falimur traveled behind them on foot. By the time he arrived the battle was concluded. The party elected Falimur to carry the dagger due to his status as a holy man.

							Rightfully fearing retaliation, the party retreated to Tilaporth to hide from Cross' pirates until things blew over. They stayed with an elderly halfling couple who gave them room and board in exchange for help on their farm.


							Orcs and Axes (12/01/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Shamous Northunder

							The heroes regrouped once enough time had passed for them to feel confident that Cross's forces were no longer actively hunting the holders of the dagger. They returned to Amarillo to obtain the second Godfall weapon discussed in the resistance meeting, this one allegedly hidden inside the palace.

							As licensed privateers of the crown they had little difficulty entering the castle. After much bribery, they quickly determined that it was held by the larger of the Lim brothers, Osbeck Lim, who the party recently learned was an orc wearing a magical disguise.

							The party attempted to talk to the dimwitted creature into handing over the priceless artifact strapped to his back. After a brief debate that devolved into combat, the party sealed all of the exits and eliminated all of the guards in the throne room. The fake Lim brothers were not quite as easily dispatched. "Osbeck" demonstrated an impressive aptitude for destruction, and "Pehr" appeared to be a gifted assassin who enhanced his abilities dark magic. Eventually the party called a ceasefire.

							"Osbeck" had a great deal of fun during the fight, which caused him to soften towards the party. The party used this to their advantage. The orc agreed to give the party his trusty war hammer in exchange for a bigger war hammer. This was an easy request to fill, and the party quickly made good on their end of the bargain. After trading war hammers with "Osbeck", the party returned to their ship.

							It became clear upon closer inspection that the war hammer they had obtained was not originally a war hammer at all. The weapon appeared to have once been some form of axe, with two cut stone caps added to convert it into a hammer. Jasper carefully removed these modifications, thus revealing the Godfall Battleaxe. This was a perfect match for the keyhole etch Zora had once made. Now in possession of both of the items needed to gain entry into the hidden chamber under the mountain on their sky island, the party decided to return to their former base of operations.

							After arriving once again on their sky island, the party was greeted by a horrible squawking sound. They followed the sound to a hut in the now vacant village. The heroes steeled themselves in preparation for whatever nightmares lay in wait, and entered the hut. The party found Thunder, Redji's goblin ward, cooking a squirrel over a bonfire made out of an old bed. The shrill shrieks had been the goblin's contended singing. Strangely, the lesser deity Telov had kept him company.

							Telov revealed that he had been placed on guard duty. While the gods did not know what was hidden inside the island's vault, they knew it must be bad. He was there to prevent anyone from going near the secret door under the mountain. Redji pointed out that this line of reasoning directly contradicted Telov's core tenets of knowledge and wisdom. Mortified at this realization, Telov left the island to ponder his life choices.

							The party promptly hoofed it to the newly unguarded vault. With both needed weapons in tow, the door opened with no issues. The door led to a large, perfectly symmetrical, rectangular room that was divided into thirds by the bizarre floorplan. The party stood in the first third, which contained only the ancient tile flooring on which the party now stood, and the door through which they had entered. The last third was identical to the first, albeit mirrored. These two sections were separated by the middle third. This third was a rectangular chasm. Even with their lanterns and magical lights, the party found that the bottom of this chasm was beyond their sight. However, the party was able to make out large forms moving up the sides of the chasm, headed in their direction. These shapes turned out to be flail snails*. A seemingly endless parade of flail snails poured out of the chasm and crawled along the walls of the room, until the wall was no longer visible. The snails did not appear to be an immediate threat.

							The party crossed the chasm, taking great pains to avoid falling into the snail filled abyss below. As the first of the heroes neared the unopened door on the opposite side of the room, the snails became more and more agitated. Realizing that an army of angry flail snails would almost certainly be the death of them, the heroes decided it best to calm the snails before proceeding. Bud and Shamous succeeded in placating the agitated snails.

							The room on the other side of the door was in stark contrast to everything else the heroes had found on the sky island. Everything the party had discovered up until this point had been decrepit and old. This room was shiny and new. At the center of the room a large wooden chest sat atop a raised platform. The party eventually discovered that the room was somehow locked in a single moment in time, and that time inside passed far more slowly than the world outside.

							Redji become too excited at the potential historical significance of whatever was stored inside the chest to consider the possibility of traps. He promptly climbed onto the platform and opened the chest. He found only a small coffer inside. As the historian tried to open the coffer, it sprang to life. Jagged teeth revealed themselves as the hinged opening of the box contorted into a fleshy grin, and tendrils erupted from all sides of the box as it grasped on to Redji's right arm. The box had been a mimic, lying in wait for countless centuries.

							Namfoodle tried to free his comrade from the slimy tendrils of the beast, but quickly became entangled himself. Bud attempted to poison it by force feeding it an unidentified mushroom he had been carrying around for several weeks. This yielded disastrous results, and the mimic swelled up and split into two mimics. After many hardships and shenanigans, the party finally managed to slay the mimics. The wretched creatures liquefied, revealing twelve ominous looking amulets.

							The party quickly identified these as the Rewera Amulets. After a lengthy discussion, the heroes decided the amulets would be safer if they left them here. They carefully placed the amulets back in the large chest and left the vault, taking care to replace the magical seals on their way out.

							While this took only a small while for the party, it was several weeks for the rest of the world.

							The party set forth once more in search of the remaining artifacts.


							Notriven (12/15/2018)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Redji Cloudtaker

							Bud, Falimur, Jasper, and Redji sailed to Wustebie to consult with Salax. As during the party's previous visit, Salax assessed the moral fiber of the heroes present. He deemed them far more worthy than the group that had consulted him previously. Consequently, he felt at ease enough to provide them with more specific information.

							While Salax had not been privy to the exact locations of all of the weapons, he did remember which cultures were asked to watch over the artifacts. The artifacts had been divided among the aarakocra, dragons, drow, dwarves, elves, firenewts, frogfolk, frost giants, gnomes, humans, lizardfolk, triton, and the Dewis.

							The heroes thanked Salax for the information, and departed to look for more of the weapons. The heroes decided to begin the next phase of their search at Notriven, a well-known seasonal nesting ground for the aarakocra.

							Notriven was well known in the surrounding area for its towering statue of Notriv, goddess of wisdom. The statue was the largest in the known world, and could be seen from many miles away. Using this as a landmark, the heroes had no issue locating the mountaintop village of Notriven.

							It was nesting season for the aarakocra, so the mountain was a bustling hub of bird folk. Fortunately, no eggs had been laid yet. Aarakocra are usually a good-hearted lot, but they become far less welcoming of outsiders when waiting for their broods to hatch.

							The party was warmly welcomed into the village. They were given free rein to explore, as long as they didn't barge into anyone's homes without asking first. The heroes found the village itself to be devoid of any real points of interest. The aarakocra built nest-like huts every nesting season, and dismantled them afterwards so as not to clutter the holy ground around the statue. Because of this, the architecture and the amenities in Notriven were minimal.

							After a brief exploration of the village, the heroes turned their attention to the statue of Notriv. Redji found an ancient engraving near the base of the statue. It had been largely worn away by centuries of harsh mountain winds, but he was able to make out a few fragments of the original celestial text. These translated roughly as "a leap of faith" and "place your soul in her hands". The heroes quickly developed a hypothesis about what the engraving meant. The hands of the statue were held in front of its torso and cupped as if holding something. The heroes decided they were meant to reach the top of the statue, and leap into the statue's hands.

							Bud used his druidic magic to take the form of a bird, and flew to the top of the statue. Jasper used her mutations to scale the sheer stone until she reached the top. Redji used his djinn heritage to make himself lighter than air, and floated to the top. Falimur had no such secret abilities or spells to allow him to climb the statue, so he convinced a few aarakocra to carry him to the top.

							Once atop the statue, the heroes took the leap of faith one by one. As each hero entered the cup of the hands, they found themselves falling into in a massive, dimly lit cavern. Gazing upwards, they could see the base of the statue. They quickly realized that the mountain was partially hollow, and they were falling to its base. As they drew closer to the ground, the heroes noticed that the entire cavern floor was covered in water. As they continued to fall, they began to notice that something was amiss with their reflections. Their reflections were but shadows, devoid of proper form. Bud used his magic to turn to smoke, and floated just above the surface of the water. Redji cast a spell upon himself to allow him to fly for around ten minutes. Jasper used her wings to glide to the nearest cavern wall, and clung to it. Falimur had no such means of stopping his descent.

							Falimur plunged into the water. As he did, his shadowy reflection broke free of the water's surface and took Falimur's place in the cavern. Under the water, Falimur found that the water was dry. It would have almost seemed as if he had emerged in the middle of the ocean, if it weren't for the fact that he could still see the cavern and his allies when he looked down. Wherever he was, the skies were darkened with storm clouds, and lit by the constant flash of lighting. During one such flash, he saw the silhouettes of several winged figures flying towards him. As they approached, he observed that they resembled heavily armored aarakocra with black feathers. The figures grasped him in their talons, and began to carry him away.

							For the heroes that remained in the cavern, the events that transpired beneath the surface of the water were barely visible. The world beneath the waves was heavily clouded to their vision, but they saw clearly enough to see Falimur be carried away by something. They entered the water in the hopes that they might rescue their comrade. As they emerged from the stormy ocean, they were each met by the same fate as Falimur. Armored, winged creatures swept each of them away in the same direction as Falimur.

							After a time, the heroes saw what was certainly their destination. A gargantuan cathedral loomed in the distance. It sat atop what appeared to be the only body of land within miles. As the heroes' captors approached, the massive doors swung open of their own accord. The heroes were carried inside, and dropped just inside the threshold. The cathedral was lined with what must have been thousands of pews. Creatures identical to the ones that had transported the heroes silently flew in place above these pews. The aisle was covered by a crimson carpet which seemed almost to call out to the heroes, inviting them to follow it to its end. With no better options, the heroes decided to follow the aisle.

							As they walked, another giant statue of Notriv slowly came into view above the altar. The statue was flanked by massive stained glass windows which depicted several warriors of varying races locked in a ferocious battle with a demonic entity.

							After what may well have been a few miles of walking, the heroes reached the altar. Eight more creatures stood upon the altar in a v-formation, with a ninth creature serving as the point of the v. The eight creatures were nearly identical to the others the party had seen, but their armor was notably more ornate, perhaps even priestly. The ninth creature had a sinister looking spear strapped to its back, and wore armor of an entirely different sort. It had more color, and more careful craftsmanship. Its feathers appeared to be blue, but were decorated with complex swirling patterns. Whatever the ninth creature was, it was likely in charge.

							The heroes continued their approach. As they neared the creatures, they broke their v-formation and surrounded the heroes instead. The creatures began to telepathically communicate with the heroes. There were no pleasantries or formalities exchanged. Instead, the creatures began an intense, lightning fast bout of questioning. They asked why the heroes had come, who they were, where they were from, what masters they served, and many other things that were asked too quickly for the heroes to process them. The heroes answered what questions they were able, and the avian priests fell silent. The ninth figure said nothing, but gestured to the eight. The eight set upon the heroes with blistering speed. They took the heroes in their talons and began to carry them away, much like the other creatures had done earlier.

							The heroes were placed atop the head of the statue, but the creatures continued to restrain the heroes. The ninth creature was the last to arrive. He pointed at Bud, and then gestured once more to the other eight. They forced Bud to his knees, and extended his neck. The other heroes tried to intervene, but were too firmly restrained. The ninth creature drew a large blade, and assumed a stance to execute Bud. The heroes grimaced as the creature prepared to swing, but the swing did not come. The ninth creature sheathed its sword burst out laughing. "Dude, you should have seen the look on your face," he guffawed in a familiar voice. He removed his helmet, revealing himself to be Quintus Skybreeze.

							Quintus ordered the eight priests to release the heroes. He explained that he had been away scouting other territories when Larazi slaughtered the citizens of the sky island. When he learned of the massacre, he decided to rest his wings in Notriven. In typical Quintus fashion he had somehow bumbled his way into glory. The spear that was strapped to his back was the Godfall Spear. He apparently also matched the criteria of the chosen one from the local bird people's prophecies, so they declared him their new leader.

							The heroes were relieved to find that the Godfall Spear lay safely in the hands of one of their more trusted allies. However, they were less pleased with the location. They knew that the forces of The Rewera were tirelessly searching for the artifacts, and feared that it was only a matter of time before they arrived here and massacred the aarakocra. They convinced Quintus to relocate his people to the Moonfire Mountains. The Rewera had already claimed the Godfall weapon from that region, so they could think of no reason for his forces to return. Quintus was satisfied with their line of reasoning, and agreed to relocate his people. He showed the heroes the way back to the mountaintop, which was to jump into the hands of the statue within the cathedral. This placed the heroes in the sky above the mountain. All of them except Falimur were able to land quite gracefully. Luckily, Falimur walked away from the fall with only minor injuries.

							Now that the Godfall Spear was accounted for, the heroes decided to move onto the next artifact. Firenewts had been among the races Salax had mentioned, so the heroes set a course for the largest colony of firenewts they knew of.

							The journey to the Firelake was quick and painless. Bud, Falimur, and Jasper surrendered themselves to the firenewts, and invoked the Rite of Challenge.  Redji decided to stay behind and watch the ship. Bud and Jasper both passed trials by combat, and Falimur passed a trial by storycrafting. Once the three heroes had earned the right to explore the volcano without being eaten, they headed for the Zaienen's palace.

							The heroes found Zaienen surprisingly agreeable. He had witnessed Bud and Jasper's combat trials, and was impressed at their prowess. He invited the heroes into his inner sanctum, which was more or less a VIP area for his elite warriors. The walls of the inner sanctum were adorned with centuries worth of carvings, each depicting a different legend, historical event, or prophesy. The heroes were intrigued by one of these carvings in particular, and asked Zaienen what it represented. Thanks to his explanation, the heroes learned that the firenewts possess a Godfall weapon, known to them as ALQATIL 'IIBLIS. Since firenewts pass down their history verbally rather than by written word, many details have become muddied over the centuries. The firenewts believe that the weapon is meant to kill dark deities, and was gifted to them by ancient races so that they could prevent an apocalypse. Because of this, the chief is always a highly trained combatant. The firenewts believe that should a dark god ever rise against them, it is the duty of the chief to slay it.

							The heroes realized that one of the many weapons on Zaienen's person was the Godfall Reaping Chain. They decided it would be unwise to make a move against Zaienen in a confined space full of his strongest warriors. The heroes made a note of the weapon for later, and departed from the Firelake.


							Morsko Dno (12/29/2018)
							Party:
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker

							Jasper, Namfoodle, and Redji decided to examine the two remaining unidentified sigil sequences on the list they obtained from Nilbog so long ago. The first of these locations was immediately familiar to Namfoodle, who recognized it as the site he and several fallen allies had obtained the Godfall Dagger. After deciding that there was no reason to delve back into the depths of the temple before them, the party attempted the next location.

							Redji cast the Teleport spell upon himself and his comrades using the final unidentified sigil sequence, and the heroes experienced the familiar whirling fade to black. They awakened atop a teleportation circle in a strange, dark place made of creaking metal. The small, shadowy room in which they now stood was empty save for the teleportation circle. The only door to the room appeared to be a sealed bulkhead. The instant one of the heroes set foot off of the teleportation circle, an alarm spell was triggered.

							The heroes heard the shuffling of several sets of heavy footsteps rushing in their direction. Jasper used her enhanced climbing ability to climb up a wall and cling to the ceiling of the room. She hid herself in a shadowy corner just before the footsteps reached the room's only door. The heavy door opened and several triton* guards entered the room. Namfoodle and Redji surrendered willingly.

							The two captured heroes were bound in heavy ropes and marched through several lengths of winding, metal corridors filled with identical bulkheads. Jasper sent her familiar, a weasel named Wesley, to perch atop Namfoodle's shoulder as he was led away. She used her psychic connection to the weasel to view the world through its eyes. Eventually, Namfoodle and Redji's captors indicated that they had reached the correct bulkhead and the march halted. The triton soldiers opened the bulkhead and marched the heroes into what appeared to be a very utilitarian war-room, where a grizzled triton general stood waiting.

							The older triton was clearly incensed at the intrusion, addressed the captured heroes with obvious disdain. He gruffly demanded to know their reason for infiltrating this stronghold, Morsko Dno. The party explained their gods-given mission to find and destroy the Godfall weapons.

							Upon hearing this, the general's demeanor shifted noticeably. He eyed the heroes appraisingly, and took a special interest in the weasel perched atop Namfoodle's shoulder. The general recognized this as a familiar and put two and two together. He looked the weasel in the eye to address the intruder that had evaded his guards. He chided Jasper for hiding instead of accepting capture like her comrades, and suggested that she should rejoin them. Satisfied, the general informed the party that they were more than welcome to keep the triton's Godfall weapon, provided they could retrieve it from the vault. The general ordered for Namfoodle and Redji to be released so that they could fetch the weapon.

							Jasper regrouped with Namfoodle and Redji. A pair of tritons escorted the heroes to the vault, and opened the bulkhead to the first section of it for them. The party finally had a chance to discuss their current situation amongst themselves, and correctly hypothesized that they stood in some form of submerged nautical vessel.

							Leaky pipes lined the walls of the otherwise seemingly empty first room within the vault. Bursts of steam escaped from the leaky pipes at regular intervals. This, combined with the sound of the walls creaking under the pressure of the sea, created an eerie feeling of isolation. As the party advanced into the room, roughly a dozen small creatures made of steam sprung forth from the leaky pipes. These creatures immediately attacked the heroes. During the ensuing fight, Namfoodle stepped on a trapped floor tile, causing large scythes embedded within the ceiling to begin swinging rhythmically throughout the room. Luckily, the three heroes present were all quite agile, and were able to nimbly avoid the swinging blades. They dispatched the last of the elemental monsters and proceeded through the next bulkhead with only minor cuts and burns.

							The next chamber contained two metal suits of armor that stood nearly four meters tall. These sprang to life and attacked the heroes. The party managed to damage one of these suits severely enough that it became inanimate. However, it had scarcely fallen to the floor before the enchantments upon it began to repair it. The party quickly decided that trying to dispatch the two armored constructs was going to leave them exhausted with little to show for it. Jasper and Namfoodle held the constructs at bay while Redji opened the bulkhead to the next room. The heroes fled into the next chamber and sealed the bulkhead behind them. The constructs did not follow.

							Six smaller suits of armor stood along the walls of the chamber in which the heroes now stood. A large metal statue of a kneeling triton stood in front of the far wall, its corroded arms outstretched as if to present the trident it held to a worthy adventurer. The heroes cautiously approached the large statue and visually inspected the trident. There was no doubt about it, this trident was a Godfall weapon. Namfoodle carefully reached for the trident. The statue's fingers quickly closed around the trident as the six suits of armor that lined the other walls leapt from their pedestals. The statue and the suits of armor attacked the party.

							Determined to escape the vault in the same number of pieces he entered, Redji quickly hatched a plan. He cast an enchantment upon himself, Jasper, and Namfoodle that would protect them from the potent blast to come, and then he cast Fireball with all the power he could muster. A blinding flash of light enveloped the room as the flames covered everything in sight. The room was too damp for the fire to take, but the force from the explosion was not lessened in the least. When the flash subsided, only the heroes and the statue remained. The blast had completely disintegrated the six suits of armor, but had done little more than strip away the corrosion from the statue whose iron flesh now glowed orange from the heat. The blast had, however, done significant damage to the structure of the room. A large gash had been torn in a weak section of one of the walls, creating a dangerous leak. The tremendous pressure of the ocean began to tear this gash open further and further. The party had only a few moments before the entire room would be completely flooded.

							Jasper recognized the orange glow of the iron golem as their best chance to separate it from the trident. The iron of the statue had been softened by the heat. Seizing on this opportunity before the rising water quenched it away, she hacked off the fingers of the giant statue. Namfoodle used the pick-pocketing skills he had honed during his penniless youth to swipe the trident away before the statue could react.

							The party finally had what they came for. However, they were trapped in a rapidly flooding vault with a living statue who they could not hope to best in combat. This would have been a nigh perfect opportunity for Redji to teleport himself and his comrades to safety, but he did not have enough magic power left in him to do so. This time it was Namfoodle's turn to save the party with his arcane prowess. He did not possess the impressive magical stamina of Redji, nor did he know as many spells, but the spells he did know were no less potent. Namfoodle cast the Tiny Hut spell, causing an impenetrable, dry dome roughly ten feet in diameter to spring into existence with the heroes located safely inside. The spell's properties meant that the dome would have an unlimited supply of oxygen, and that no other creatures or constructs could enter. The shelter would only last eight hours, but that would be enough. That would be enough time for the heroes to get some rest, and for Redji's magic power to return to him.

							The heroes had an uneasy sleep while the golem made a tireless, futile assault on the sides of the dome. With some of his magical power returned, Redji began to cast the spell to transport himself and his allies to another location. He chose to travel back to the teleportation circle where the party had first entered Morsko Dno.

							Once again the party stepped off of the teleportation circle, and once again the alarm sounded. This time, however, the heroes strode confidently into the war room. The heroes announced their success to the surprised general and his attending aides. After a brief bit of gloating, Redji decided to fulfil the task he had returned for. Redji warned the general that other, more sinister forces knew the sigil sequence to enter Morsko Dno. He explained that these forces were evil, unable to be reasoned with, and had numbers and strength that the tritons could not hope to resist. He pleaded with the general to relocate his people away from the teleportation circle. However, the tritons were far too confident in their own strength. In their pride, they refused.

							Satisfied that he had done all he could, Redji cast the teleportation spell once more, this time targeting the city of Amarillo.


							Setbacks (01/12/2019)
							Party:
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Seabern Forestgloom
							Shamous Northunder
							Zenrya Fastfoot

							Since ascending to the throne of the underworld, the Rewera had taken several lesser deities hostage. While their disappearances are increasingly widely-known, the reason behind the disappearances was known to only a few. The missing demigods were to be fodder for the Rewera once he obtained more amulets. The prisoners were:
								• Gillywung
								• Klause
								• Mosoc
								• Ochiphe
								• Telov

							This news reached Cross's ears within his flying fortress. This inspired the pirate lord to issue a bounty on the heads of all demigods. Once he obtains one, he intends to use it as bait to lure the god of death out of hiding.

							Meanwhile, Rewera's forces had become far more openly hostile in their dealings. No longer content to operate in shadow, they now raided villages and cities with full scale invasions. Using his limited knowledge of teleportation circles tied to the history of the Godfall artifacts, Rewera began to send forces en masse to obtain the weapons. Consequently, the forces of Rewera are quickly becoming exceedingly active in the Sky Isle, Notriven, the Firelake, the Wetwood, and Morsko Dno.

							The party began to scout Lagos to find the remaining artifacts. While en route to Budopolis, they noticed the wreckage of a pre-airship zeppelin in the Wetwood. They stopped to investigate this, and found a large number of curious magic tools and trinkets, including an enchanted deck of playing cards.

							Redji had read legends of such decks during his years of study in Amarillo. He explained to his companions that the origin of these decks was unknown, but they were enchanted by powerful magic that remained a mystery to even the wisest wizards. The decks were for a simple game of chance with potentially life changing stakes. Any interested parties simply indicated how many cards they wished to draw from the deck, and then drew them. The decks directly enforced the stated number of cards. If a player refused to draw the stated number of cards, the cards would simply throw themselves at the player. There was a large number of unique cards within each deck, with each card having a distinct outcome associated to it. These outcomes could bring great fortune or great tragedy.

							Now educated as to the rules and nature of the game, Namfoodle decided to draw one card. He drew a card with a picture of a meteor. He felt a sudden surge of knowledge as his already significant skill for sleight of hand doubled in potency.

							The rest of the party became very courageous upon seeing Namfoodle's luck. Shamous stated his intent to draw one card. He drew a card with an image of a skull. A wraith cloaked in black, tattered robes suddenly appeared beside him. It manifested a large scythe in one of its bony hands, and viciously attacked Shamous with unrelenting fury. The rest of the party found themselves magically compelled not to intervene, and so stood back. After a long, harrowing battle, Shamous was able to destroy the specter.

							Undeterred by the outcome that Shamous had received, the party continued to draw from the deck. Falimur announced his intent to draw a single card. He drew a card adorned with an image of the sun. He felt his mind flooded with knowledge as his understanding of the arcane arts dramatically deepened. The card was not yet finished though. Falimur felt a comforting warmth in his right hand. As he looked at his hand, a sword enchanted with the power of the sun came into being in his grasp.

							Jasper announced her intent to draw two cards from the deck. She drew a card bearing the image of a star. She felt a surge of energy as her dexterity suddenly increased, leaving her more nimble and able to dodge attacks. As she drew her second card, she observed that it bore the image of a dungeon cell. The other heroes looked on helplessly as she was forcibly teleported to an unknown location. The effect left behind all of her clothes, equipment and armor, which fell to the ground where Jasper had stood.

							The party stood in flabbergasted horror at what had just transpired. Namfoodle was the first to come to his senses. He gathered and neatly folded Jasper's things, so that he might return them to her if she were ever found.

							Perturbed but undeterred, Redji stated his intention to draw a single card. He drew a card whose face was solid black, bearing no image. He felt a searing pain as his soul was torn from his body and cast somewhere far away. Redji's body collapsed to the ground.

							Falimur rushed to the side of the fallen wizard. Redji's body was vacant, but not dead. Falimur carried Redji's dormant body to the ship and placed it carefully in Redji's bunk. Thunder, Redji's goblin ward, vowed to remain here and keep watch over his master's husk.

							With no wizard left to consult for a course of action, the party decided to pay a visit to Salax Dolv in Wustebie. They brought Redji's empty husk and Jasper's belongings to the kobold elder. Salax praised the party for their wisdom in bringing the husk and belongings to him, and stated that he believed he would be able to use these to divine the whereabouts of their allies. Using magic that seemed suspiciously advanced for a lowly kobold, he was able to narrow down the locations of Jasper as well as Redji's soul. The magic showed him that Jasper had been teleported directly into a cell, and that Redji's soul had been placed inside a random piece of machinery. Both were located in an uncharted portion of The Great Rampart, a mountain range on the continent of Paros. He marked the specific location on the party's map, but warned them that the area was enclosed within an impenetrable magical barrier. The party thanked Salax for his guidance and departed from Wustebie.

							In need of a place to lick their wounds, the party traveled to the coastal city of Tilaporth. Here they visited an inn in run by a cheerful halfling named Perrin Brushgather. The party immediately found the bubbly halfling endearing, and came to trust him dangerously quickly. Luckily, the halfling was as altruistic as he seemed. The party reserved a somewhat secluded booth to discuss their next move over a meal.

							With their numbers diminished, the party sought to bolster their ranks as they mounted a rescue operation. Perrin overheard the party's conversation about hiring mercenaries. The halfling politely butted into the conversation and asked why the party needed hired hands, and what they were looking for in their sellswords. The party truthfully informed the little barkeep that they needed the help to rescue their friends. Perrin was satisfied with the reason, and asked the heroes in a low voice (so as not to embarrass them) what their budget was. Unfortunately, Redji had served as the party banker, and kept all of the money in an extradimensional safe that he called forth from the ether anytime money needed to be withdrawn. With Redji out of the picture, so was the party's money. The heroes confessed to Perrin that they had very little money at present. Upon hearing this, Perrin waived the fee for the heroes' meals, and explained that he had a few suggestions for them.

							Perrin explained that the best mercenaries come from guilds, but with a shoestring budget the party really only had one option. A very recently founded guild called Polyforce had been operating in region around Amarillo. They were largely an unknown, but the rumors that had come through the inn suggested that they were a group of misfit do-gooders. If the rumors were to be believed, Polyforce were very selective in their contracts, but did not charge for their services.

							The safer option would be to hire freelancers. Wandering adventurers who had no guild affiliation, and typically had more negotiable prices. The party decided to pursue this option. Perrin was happy to arrange for the party to meet with a few viable candidates. After conducting some brief interviews, the party hired two adventurers to aid them in their quest; Seabern, an elven bard, and Zenrya, a halfling wizard.

							The heroes stayed the night in the inn, and departed for the western continent of Paros the following morning.


							Stonweald (01/26/2019)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Seabern Forestgloom
							Shamous Northunder
							Zenrya Fastfoot

							The party regrouped with Bud during their journey westward. The heroes reached the east coast of Paros after a lengthy (if uneventful) journey. They didn't stop to sightsee, but they made notes of any interesting looking locations for later. Chiefest of these noted locations was the Thunder Plains. The largest portion of The Great Rampart was located near the center of Paros' landmass, so the heroes flew inland. Here, they made port at the dwarven city state of Stonweald near the base of the mountain range.

							Bud was not nearly as destitute as the rest of the party. He had implemented massive reforms to the city of Budopolis since rising to the throne. Many of these reforms were commerce related, and had left him obscenely wealthy. He covered the costs for the port fee and several weeks of dockage for their ship. Bud also paid in advance to have comfortable rooms for all the current party members and their two missing friends for the next several weeks.

							None of the maps the party had received from Smith contained detailed enough information to plan a viable expedition into The Great Rampart, so the heroes decided to find a local cartographer or adventurer with knowledge of the peaks. However, Stonweald was a massive and unfamiliar city, so the heroes began their search by asking around at nearby inns and taverns.

							In one of these taverns, the party heard a rumor that the feared pirate captain Namfoodle had come to Stonweald about a week ago seeking new corsairs for his bloodthirsty crew. After a brief investigation the party found the other captain Namfoodle in another tavern. The party questioned the other Namfoodle and quickly determined that the second captain Namfoodle was nothing more than an imposter, having copied the real Namfoodle's name and fashion sense in order to benefit from his reputation. The imposter didn't recognize the real Namfoodle, due to his reincarnation as a tiefling. The real Namfoodle found the situation amusing enough that he left without taking action against his doppelganger.

							Zenrya spent some time researching the area in an attempt to find a teleportation circle. She was able to locate one near the center of Stonweald, and copied the sigil sequence into her journal for later.

							After another few hours of searching, the party found a small map store run by an eccentric gnome known only as "The Cartoholic". The gnome explained that he had not found an opportunity to explore the peaks himself, and his apprentices were either too cowardly or too fragile to explore the peaks without an escort. To this end, the gnome proposed an exchange of services. One of his apprentices would accompany the party through the peaks as a guide, and the party would protect the apprentice so they would survive long enough to make a usable map. The heroes liked the idea, but were uncomfortable with the idea of taking only one apprentice, in case the apprentice's knowledge of the area was lacking or they had an unfortunate accident on the road. After a bit of negotiating, the Cartoholic agreed to send all four of his employees with the party.

							Early the following morning, the heroes met the four misfit apprentices at an agreed upon location at the edge of town.
								• Gruskeggom, a dwarf locked inside a large stone box attached to mechanical legs.
								• Jerrold Holemund, a middle aged tiefling bard, and the Cartoholic's best mapmaker.
								• Gearbox, a peculiar rogue modron outfitted with custom upgrades for cartography and approximate global positioning.
								• Marie Flomaud, an aldruna witch who was incredibly attached to her cat familiar.

							The newly formed expedition party began their trek towards The Great Rampart. The party encountered some peculiar non-hostile wildlife and got to know their guides a little better, but the journey to the foothills was otherwise uneventful.

							It was sunset when the heroes reached the foothills. Gruskeggom asked the party to halt a moment, and proceeded to explain that he knew a shortcut through the foothills. However, he did not believe he could find the shortcut while locked in a giant stone box. After a brief debate, the party voted to unlock the Gruskeggom's box.

							The instant the last latch was unfastened, Gruskeggom hurled the lid with inhuman strength. The party immediately recognized their mistake. Gruskeggom was a vampire, and the stone box had been to prevent him from feeding on the blood of the living. Fortunately, Gruskeggom had also made a glaring mistake. By his estimate it should have been dusk at this time, but when he opened the box he was met by the searing light of the sunset. Weakened and in pain, the dwarven vampire fled into a nearby forest. The party gave chase, but were ultimately unable to stop Gruskeggom's escape.

							The heroes and their remaining guides continued their journey onward. Eventually they came upon a cavern entrance that Jerrold believed would lead the heroes deeper into the mountains. The party made camp in the caverns for the night. The following morning, the heroes resumed their quest. The party was able to find their way through the caverns with assistance from Gearbox and his global positioning modifications. They encountered a large, lethargic rock monster sleeping in front of a passageway in the caverns. They opted to wake the creature and convince it to step aside rather than take the longer path out of the caverns. This saved them several days of travel time.

							The party exited the cavern and found themselves at the edge of a large canyon surrounded by sheer walls of mountains on all sides. A small island hovered in the center of this canyon, too distant to reach without some type of flying vehicle. It was clear that the island was their destination, but the heroes had a more immediate concern, for they were not alone on the small ledge. A towering sphynx sat beside what appeared to be a metal pier. The sphynx informed the heroes that it could call a ferry for them, but would only do so if they could beat it in a battle of wits. Fortunately, Zenrya was a wizard, and wizards are famously intelligent and learned. The party conquered the challenge of the sphynx and won passage to the island.

							A figure cloaked in heavy, dark robes piloted a ferry to the metal pier where there the party and the sphynx stood. The party boarded the ferry. Without a word, the hooded ferry captain began the trip back across the seemingly bottomless canyon. The pilot remained silent the entire journey. The party was able to catch a glimpse beneath the hood, and found that the pilot's face had been peeled away. The party found their desire to talk to the pilot greatly diminished, and sat in uncomfortable silence until they reached the pier of the floating island…


							Monastery Rescue (02/09/2019)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Zenrya Fastfoot
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Seabern Forestgloom
							Shamous Northunder

							The expedition members disembarked onto the floating island. The island was dotted with decrepit structures that appeared too alien to have originated from this world. The heroes observed a number of cloaked figures moving about the otherwise vacant island. These cloaked figures noticed the heroes' presence on the island, but made no effort to intercept or interact with them.

							The heroes approached one of the cloaked individuals and asked if they had seen any mutant elven women or disembodied souls nearby. The stranger replied that he had not, but suggested that the heroes consult with the leader of their "esteemed" order. The heroes correctly took this to mean that the island was the base of operations for a cult. The cultist pointed out the building where the head of the cult dwelled. He wished the heroes luck, but there was an obvious undertone of malice in his words. Despite this, the heroes had no better ideas to speak of and so heeded the cultist's advice. Marie decided to continue to explore the island, but the rest of the party entered the building to meet with the head of the order.

							The interior of the building vaguely resembled a throne room, but like everything else on the island its design was extremely alien. A large, boney demon sat comfortably atop a menacing throne, flanked by two faceless orc cultists. The party approached the throne to address the demon, but it was Jerrold who spoke first. He stepped away from the party and loudly proclaimed to the demon that he wished to join the esteemed order, and had brought the rest of the expedition members as an offering. The demon seemed pleased with this offer.

							The demon wasted no time in enjoying his new playthings. He drew a terrifying spear made of the spine of some long-dead beast, then he and his orc entourage engaged the heroes. Jerrold fled while the heroes were too busy to exact revenge for his betrayal. The battle was brief but fierce. The heroes dispatched the orcs with ease. The demon, however, lived up to the reputation of his people. The party managed to slay the hellish creature, but not before he cleaved Shamous head from his body.

							Falimur beseeched the gods for aid, and quickly set to work using his holy powers to delay The Rewera claiming Shamous soul as long as possible. Bud had used a large amount of his magic during the fight with the demon, but had enough remaining to attempt to reincarnate his fallen ally once more. Bud and Falimur's efforts paid off. Shamous was restored to life in the form of a tortle.

							The heroes and Gearbox exited the now bloodied throne room. The cultists who were close enough to see the heroes' exit quickly pieced together what had happened and became hostile. The heroes were exhausted from their previous fight, but were still far beyond the abilities of a few simple cultists. They quickly dispatched their assailants.

							The party began to search the other buildings on the island for Jasper and Seabern. They stumbled onto the building that served as a dungeon for the cults prisoners. Prisoners were held inside of large crates made from thick, otherworldly metal. The heroes slew all but one of the guards, who they kept alive for questioning. They forced the guard to explain to them how to open the crates. The party had no way to see who or what was held in each of the completely translucent crates, so they opened all of them. Several of the prisoners immediately attacked the heroes, having been driven mad by months or years of torture. The party slew these prisoners as quickly and painlessly as possible.

							Finally, they stumbled onto the crate that contained Jasper. Despite being unarmed, she had managed to dispatch two guards during their first and only attempt to remove her from her cell to torture her. The other guards resealed her inside her cell, and dared not open it since. Namfoodle returned Jasper's neatly folded clothes to her, and provided her a blanket in which to wrap herself. While her resolve remained unshaken, days of starvation had left Jasper too weak to aid the party in exploring the rest of the island. Bud provided Jasper with a room key and detailed directions to the hotel at which he had booked rooms for everyone. Zenrya used the sigil sequence she had recorded in her notebook to task a teleportation spell on Jasper, whisking her away to the safety of Stonweald.

							The heroes and Gearbox continued their search. They bumped into Jerrold inside a building that seemed to serve as a makeshift barracks. They slew Jerrold with extreme prejudice, and retrieved the maps he had made during their expedition. They then took a few moments to desecrate his corpse. Aside from the cathartic experience, the barracks held little of value.

							The next building the party explored appeared to be the torture chamber. The party arrived just in time to interrupt a gruesome ceremony. They easily dispatched the cultists. Unfortunately, they were too late to save the victim. He lived just long enough to thank the party before succumbing to his wounds.

							After that, the party entered what appeared to function as a kitchen of sorts. Here they found Marie delightedly sitting in the middle of absolute chaos. She possessed a deck of cards identical to the one that had started this whole mess, and had somehow convinced over a dozen cultists to play a twisted version of roulette using the cards. The heroes watched just long enough to watch Marie cast a spell to disintegrate a cultist who refused to draw a card on his turn. The party decided it best to leave Marie to her fun, and departed for the next building.

							The following building appeared to be some sort of engine room, and contained a staggering amount of moving parts. This matched the rough description of Redji's location that the heroes had received from Salax, so they set to work investigating machinery. This was Gearbox's moment to shine. As a mechanical being from the mechanical plane of law, he was uniquely equipped to assist the party with such a situation. He explained that this room housed an exceedingly sophisticated machine known as a computer, and that he could try to ask it which of its components Redji resided in. The party agreed to give this course of action a try.

							Gearbox took one of the many exposed bundles of wires from a wall whose panel had long since fallen away. The friendly robot carefully separated the individual wires, evaluated their purposes, and carefully wired them into his own mechanical body. It quickly became evident that the computer was a far more sinister mechanical being that Gearbox, and it seemed that the computer was attempting to assimilate the small robot. Despite this, the party allowed Gearbox to continue his efforts. This paid off. Gearbox was able to determine and describe the exact magical component which housed Redji's soul. In their haste to recover Redji, the heroes did not think to rescue Gearbox from the computer. They retrieved the component that held Redji, after which they returned to check on Gearbox. By this time he had been fully assimilated, and was far beyond the heroes' ability to save.

							With Redji's soul retrieved, the party had everything they came for. They made one last sweep to scavenge any weapons or artifacts that might benefit them, and had moderate success. Seabern decided to stay on the island and reform the cult into something less horrific. Zenrya used teleportation magic to return herself and the other remaining party members to Stonweald.

							Upon their return to Stonweald, the party was able to reunite Redji's soul with his body. It was roughly 8:00 am by this time. The heroes gave into their exhaustion and slept, waking in the late afternoon. They returned to the Cartoholic and explained the events that had transpired. He was less than thrilled at losing so many apprentices, but was grateful for the thorough maps from Jerrold. He presented the heroes with several maps of the other regions of Paros as a reward.

							The heroes chose to spend the remainder of the evening celebrating their reunion, knowing they would have to return to their harrowing quest for the Godfall weapons the next morning.


							Treasure of the Firenewts (02/23/2019)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Zenrya Fastfoot

							For the next leg of their quest, the heroes decided to focus on obtaining the Godfall Weapon that lay within the Firelake.  The journey from Stonweald to the Firelake was uneventful.

							It was immediately apparent to the heroes that The Rewera's forces had been very active in the Firelake recently. Charred fragments of undead warriors littered the ground near the teleportation circle within the mountain. The firenewts seemed to be exhausted from The Rewera's constant invasions, and the number of their warriors was noticeably lessened. However, it was also clear that the firenewts had been successful in repelling the invading undead thus far. The newts' affinity for fire gave them a natural advantage over the desiccated corpses that comprised The Rewera's armies. Consequently, the fallen undead far outnumbered the fallen firenewts.

							The party realized that the attempted invasions meant they had precious little time to retrieve the artifact from the firenewts if they were to prevent it from falling into the hands of The Rewera. By this point the heroes were quite familiar with the Rite of Challenge. Bud and Falimur still carried the marks they had earned during their previous visit to the Firelake, and so were allowed entry. The remaining heroes surrendered themselves to the firenewts and invoked the Rite of Challenge.

							Redji selected trial by combat. He was escorted to the combat pools by the injured firenewt that was to be his opponent. Redji's opponent could scarcely stand, let alone put up a fight. Redji quickly defeated the firenewt in combat, but decided to spare his life. The audience mocked and hissed at Redji's mercy, but the injured firenewt was appreciative.

							Zenrya opted for trial by story-crafting. She failed to consider that this relied heavily on communication, and she did not share any languages with the firenewts. Luckily, Namfoodle was able to cast a spell upon her that allowed her to understand and speak all languages for an hour. With the aid of Namfoodle's spell, Zenrya was able to pass her challenge.

							Namfoodle chose to undergo trial by song, but demanded that his opponent be Zainen, the chieftain of the firenewts. He had correctly surmised that the firenewts chose their leader based on strength and competition, and hoped that by defeating the sitting ruler he might replace him. Predictably, Zaienen was too prideful to decline Namfoodle's challenge. Namfoodle beat Zaienen in a rap battle, and was consequently declared the new Zaienen. This title was accompanied by the responsibility of carrying the firenewts' sacred weapon, the Godfall Reaping Chain. Having obtained another artifact, Namfoodle swiftly fled the Firelake with the rest of the party in tow.

							With but a few hours of daylight remaining, the party decided to check in with the aarakocra community in the Moonfire Mountains. They were relieved to find that their allies remained safe. Quintus offered the party shelter for the night. The heroes accepted this offer with the intention of resuming their quest in the morning.

							As morning broke, the heroes picked up a broadcast from Cross on the communication crystals they still carried. The broadcast detailed a hefty bounty from the pirate-emperor. Cross was willing to pay the first pirate to bring him the Godfall Dagger 15,000 platinum. He also offered an additional 15,000 platinum if the pirate holding the dagger was a capable warrior and willing to assist him in a murder.

							The heroes had been vaguely aware of Cross' sinister machinations for some time, but had not yet pieced together his larger plan. Only Zora had understood Cross' true designs, and she had taken those secrets to her grave. The party chose to ignore the broadcast. However, they did decide that it would be best to keep an extra low profile to avoid bounty hunters seeking the dagger.

							In light of The Rewera's increasing attacks on locations that were known to have Godfall artifacts, the heroes decided it would be prudent to warn Amarillo. They arrived in the capital city only to learn that they were already too late. The Rewera's forces had passed through several days ago and slain anyone who got in their way, including Osbeck Lim. The Rewera's minions mistook the hammer that the heroes traded Osbeck for a Godfall weapon, and carried it with them when they left.


							The Verdant Isle (03/09/2019)
							Party:
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Shamous Northunder

							The Rewera wisely continued to remain in the underworld. A god is strongest in his own domain, and he knew that the other gods would not risk facing him in his ill-gotten fortress. His minions, however, were disposable and nearly limitless.   He regularly sent forth armies of the damned to seek the Godfall weapons, as well as the amulets that were taken from him so long ago. Any innocents slain along the way simply bolstered his ranks. Rewera's ability to send armies of the undead to invade the living was slowed only by the efforts of his divine counter balance, Vidan, god of life. Even so, the scales tipped slowly in the Rewera's favor. With each new life extinguished, his strength grew and Vidan's waned. If this were to be a war of attrition, the Rewera's victory was a surety.

							The heroes noticed the increasing activity of the Rewera's forces. It was only now that they realized the paltry magical seals protecting the amulets would be little more than a nuisance to a necromancer powerful enough to usurp a god. Upon this revelation, they quickly made a course once for the sky island.

							The heroes found the sky island already in the midst of an invasion by the undead. Much like before, zombies poured forth from an arcane gate atop the monument S'kra'p'ap and his people once restored. This time, however, they were far greater in number. A large number of zombies had gathered around the cave opening, with what appeared to be hundreds more shambling in that direction. The zombies did not appear to have breached the seals.

							With the understanding that this may be their last chance to prevent the Rewera from reclaiming his amulets, the party decided to act. Namfoodle took the helm and steered the airship above the cave opening. Redji cast the spell Feather Fall upon himself, Falimur, and Shamous, thus allowing them to jump from the ship without being harmed by the fall. With no time to lose, they leapt to the ground below.

							Shamous acted quickly from the moment he touched down. He channeled the forces of nature to create a concussive blast of wind, clearing the zombies from in front of the door. He called to the earth, and sheer stones shot straight upward from the ground, creating a circular wall 20' high around the heroes and the door. Redji quickly set to work undoing the magical barriers that barred entry to the cave. However, this would take time. Time they didn't have.

							The wall bought the heroes some time, but it meant tragically little in the face of an unending force. The zombies began to climb the sides of the wall, slowly trickling into the arena Shamous had created. Redji continued to dispel the seals while Falimur and Shamous kept the zombies at bay, and Jasper hurled blasts of magical fire over the rails of the airship. As the zombies continued to filter in, Shamous and Falimur found in increasingly difficult to combat their sheer numbers.

							Falimur called upon the holy power the gods had granted him with all of his remaining magic. He rebuked the zombies with a great and terrible voice, causing all of the zombies within 30' of Shamous's barrier to fall lifeless once more. This bought the heroes precious little time.

							The zombies began to use the corpses of their fallen brethren to scale the wall, allowing them to clear the wall far more efficiently than before. With much of their strength already spent, Falimur and Shamous had little hope of enduring the hordes that now breached the barrier. Redji had nearly completed his work, but the heroes would surely be devoured in the time it took for him to remove the final seals.

							Jasper saw the increasingly hopeless situation from the airship, and lowered a rope for her earthbound comrades. She took care to stop when the rope was about 30' from the ground to ensure that the undead could not grab hold. Redji channeled the last of his magic energy to temporarily grant himself, Shamous, and Falimur unnatural jumping ability. They leapt to the rope and grabbed hold. Jasper hoisted her comrades back to the deck. Namfoodle set a course for someplace where they could recuperate.

							The party made port at Vidan's Rest, a sprawling city on the southern coast of the Verdant Isle. The city held fast to the tenets of Vidan, and the god of life himself served as the city's benefactor and defender. Vidan's efforts to control the spread of The Rewera's corruption were most noticeable here. It was widely known that there had never been a recorded sighting of an undead creature on the Verdant Isle, and even in these times that remained true. That made the island seem an especially promising place to plan their next move.

							The heroes decided to spend a day or two exploring the island and gathering as much pertinent information for their quest as possible. During their investigation, the heroes heard a local legend of a sacred weapon that was given to a secret tribe deep in the forests of the Verdant Isle. They decided it would be wise to investigate that.

							The heroes rented horses and traveled further inland to scout the forests. During their travels, the party spotted bandits lying in wait further along the road. They prepared themselves for combat, but this never came. The party witnessed nine stegosaurus ridden by kobolds erupt from the tree line and trample the bandits to death. Before the heroes could brush off their shock, the kobolds gathered the bandit's corpses and left. The heroes learned that the southern forests were the favored hunting ground of a pack of feral kobolds who rode domesticated stegosaurus.

							Further in, the party encountered an adolescent kobold. The kobold introduced herself as Zig, and explained in a broken accent that she had become lost. She asked the party for assistance reuniting with her tribe. The party agreed, and assisted Zig in climbing into Jasper's backpack.

							The heroes continued to scout the forests for evidence of the sacred weapon from the legend, but to no avail. Shamous suggested that secret tribe from the legend may have been the grippli that had once slain him. The other heroes agreed that this seemed likely.

							As the sun began to set, the heroes made camp in the forests north of Vidan's Rest. The night was ultimately uneventful. The heroes found the gods to be abnormally talkative during their prayers the next morning.

							Redji prayed to Chromus, god of time. Chromus informed Redji that 'The key to the future lies in the events of the past.'

							Falimur prayed to all the prime deities (except The Rewera). Spaxis, god of chaos, informed Falimur that "The solution to all this Rewera tom-foolery, could likely be found by buying some jewelry". Notriv, goddess of wisdom, informed Falimur that the gods can no longer feel Klause's life force. Klause had been missing for weeks, presumably held captive by The Rewera. The fact that the gods could no longer feel his presence meant that he had likely been executed.

							News of Klause's death brought a terrible realization upon the heroes. Demigods had been slowly going missing for weeks, but were only held prisoner. The Rewera certainly would have begun to slay them much sooner if he had a means of absorbing their souls, so he must have been biding his time until he could obtain more amulets. The heroes' earlier efforts had left the cache of amulets far more vulnerable than they had found them. The weakened defenses around the amulets had allowed The Rewera's forces to retrieve them for their dark master.

							This meant that The Rewera had twelve amulets, and the forces of good had none. Without an amulet to contain The Rewera's soul, victory could not be assured. Even if the heroes were able to use the weapons to slay the dark deity, his soul would likely just be sent to the afterlife… which also happened to be his domain. This effectively meant that The Rewera could not truly be slain without one his own amulets.

							Shamous suggested that the heroes should separate to cover more ground. Since he was the only one familiar with Thistleton, he would scout it out. Jasper volunteered to accompany Shamous and continue to search for Zig's tribe. The rest of the party returned to Vidan's Rest to go jewelry shopping and plan their next course of action.


							Echoes of the Past (03/16/2019)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Falimur Lightbringer
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Teomyr Thorsson
							Zenrya Fastfoot

							The journey back to Vidan's Rest was quiet, save for one or two more stegosaurus hit and runs.

							After asking around for directions, the party managed to find a respected shop that dealt in magical jewelry. The party chatted for a while with the crazy eyed dwarf who ran the establishment. They asked him if it were theoretically possible to design an amulet that could absorb the essence of a god. The dwarf scoffed, but stated that if it were possible, it would probably be through the use of a very large black diamond, and he was pretty sure those were little more than a fairy tale. Even if they did exist, the amulet would still have to be enchanted through some sort of dark ritual, and it would take years if not decades to discover the ritual. The party asked if the fairy tales ever mentioned where black diamonds came from. The dwarf replied that according to the legends, the black diamonds could only be found on the continent of Decapos, "in the heart of a lost empire that slumbers in the shadow of the mountains". The party thanked the dwarf for his time, and left to seek out the lost kingdom from the stories.

							Party sailed south for Decapos, and arrived with little trouble. The eastern portion of the continent was lined with massive mountain ranges on the north and south coasts. The party decided that the area between these mountain ranges was probably what was meant by "the shadow of the mountains", and began their search here.

							The party carefully surveyed the area from the air. They spotted some sinister looking walled ruins set into the base of one of the mountains. According to their maps, these were the remains of an ancient city known as Grandcrest. The party decided to land just outside the ruined city and make the rest of the trip on foot.

							As the party entered through the gate, it was immediately clear that this was the "heart of the lost empire" from the legends. The city clearly had not been inhabited in centuries, but the evil presence of its original denizens still lingered on the chilled air. The victims of the evil empire still wandered its streets. Zombies and specters were everywhere, but they were too busy slowly rebuilding the city to notice or interfere with the heroes.

							The heroes continued to walk the main road into the city. Up ahead, they could see that it ended at a large, unsettling wizard tower. As the party drew closer, they could make out an inhuman silhouette perched atop the tower, supervising the reconstruction of the evil kingdom. Undeterred, the party continued their approach.

							As the party neared the base of the tower, they recognized the silhouette as the hunchbacked figure of a sarakt*. The sarakt greeted the heroes and bid them welcome to his kingdom. He commended them on their foolish bravery in entering the accursed walls of Grandcrest, but informed them that they were too late to avert the coming storm. The Rewera was playing the long game, and it was finally time to play his hand. There was nothing anyone, mortal or otherwise, could do to stop him now.

							Redji took it upon himself to explain to the sarakt why he was wrong. He explained that he and his comrades had obtained several of the Godfall Weapons. The sarakt feigned doubt, and Redji produced the dagger to prove his claims.

							No sooner had Redji drawn the dagger than the ancient demon leapt down from its tower and began a brutal onslaught focused on Redji. Redji nimbly dodged his initial attacks, which prompted the sarakt to call out to his undead workforce to attack. Swarms of undead began to converge on the heroes' location with murderous intent.

							The heroes valiantly held back the undead as best they could while fighting the sarakt, but the strength of their foes seemed insurmountable. The sarakt wielded powerful dark magic, and proved to be the most fearsome foe the party had yet faced. Falimur was wounded during the battle. The sarakt saw this as his opportunity to strike, and cast a terrible spell on Falimur, who was instantly disintegrated.

							Overwhelmed, Zenrya fled from the battle. She cast a spell to encapsulate herself in an impenetrable, transparent orb and retreated to the ship, only to find it occupied by two hobgoblins and a human cleric named Teomyr. They had come to the ship to prevent the party from wandering into Grandcrest, in the hopes of saving them from a grisly fate. Upon seeing a survivor, the hobgoblins felt that they had done their good deed for the day and left. Grumschs, the more talkative of the two, wished Zenrya and Teomyr good luck and informed them that he could be found in Bashnya Strazha if they found themselves in need of assistance. Zenrya quickly gave Teomyr a summary of what was happening in the city, and decided to bring the ship around.

							Back at the tower, the battle continued to rage. The increasingly exhausted heroes were able to narrowly slay the sarakt. He croaked out a horrid laugh during his final moments, and told the heroes that their fate was sealed. Death would reunite him his master, The Rewera, and he would tell his master every piece of information that Redji had shared. With the hunchbacked demon out of the way, the party could now focus their efforts on the seemingly endless swarms of undead.

							Meanwhile, Zenrya found herself too short too effectively steer the ship, and offered the helm to Teomyr. After nearly crashing the vessel, he was booted from the wheel and Thunder steered the ship to Grandcrest. Teomyr lowered the anchor so that the remaining heroes on the ground level could climb up for a safe extraction. Bud brought Falimur's corpse with him in the hopes of casting a reincarnation spell on him.

							Once the heroes were safely aboard the ship, Bud attempted to restore Falimur to life through a reincarnation spell. Unfortunately, The Rewera's influence was too strong in the region, and Bud was unable to call back Falimur's soul. He cut off one of Falimur's fingers so that he could try again if they managed to break The Rewera's grasp on his soul. The heroes then gathered any valuable equipment that Falimur had carried, and burned his body so that it could not be reanimated by the dark forces.

							The party used the safety of the ship to rain down artillery and magic upon the undead hordes. There were too many for one ship to effectively destroy them all, but they were able to clear a perimeter around the tower. Once they felt it was safe, Bud, Redji, and Teomyr disembarked to investigate the tower while Namfoodle and Zenrya provided cover from above.

							The party managed to locate two black diamond amulets, and an old laboratory filled with notes, artifacts, and scrolls. Among these was The Rewera's journal, which contained his notes on the ritual to convert black diamond amulets into Rewera Amulets.


							The Frogfolk of Thistleton (03/23/2019)
							Party:
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Shamous Northunder

							After parting ways with their comrades, Jasper, Shamous, and Zig headed north towards Thistleton. They were stopped about a mile outside of town by a patrolling grippli hunter. Shamous recognized the grippli as Ribbert, the local he had briefly spoken to during his last visit to Thistleton. Shamous still harbored a grudge against the nearby frogfolk for murdering him, but Ribbert had been kind to him, so he held no ill will toward the hunter.

							Shamous explained that even though he didn't look it, he was the lost firbolg who had passed through some months prior. He further explained that he had changed species due to a resurrection ritual after Ribbert's people had killed him in cold blood. Ribbert expressed dismay at Shamous claims that the grippli had murdered him. He apologized for what had happened, but said that he thought the new look was much cooler. Shamous went on to introduce Jasper and Zig before explaining the reason for their visit.

							Ribbert was understanding of their plight, and informed the heroes that The Rewera's corrupting influence had even reached the sacred forest in which they stood. Several weeks ago, Thisleton's beloved god-queen, Gillywung, had gone missing. The evidence pointed to abduction. Since then, the grippli had been awaiting a sign from the gods. They were a deeply religious people, and the loss of Gillywung had left them shaken. Ribbert expressed his hopes that the heroes' arrival was that sign.

							The friendly frogman suggested that the weapon they sought would certainly be held by the Council of Elders, and that the heroes should gain an audience with them. However, this would be more complicated than it sounded. The grippli were a traditionally non-confrontational people, and had built their city so that it could be made almost perfectly camouflaged at a moment's notice. If the heroes were spotted approaching, the entire town would immediately go into hiding.

							Ribbert believed himself to be an excellent judge of character, and had decided shortly after meeting the heroes that he trusted them completely. He offered to help disguise the heroes so that they could enter the city. Like most grippli, Ribbert had a knack for alchemy. He could supply the heroes with potions to temporarily transform them into grippli, but informed them that this would come at a cost, and would only work for adults (Zig would have to forego the potion). He offered the heroes the option of either paying 500 gold each, or drinking one experimental potion each.

							The heroes opted to drink experimental potions rather than paying a large sum of gold. Ribbert doffed his pack and opened it to reveal five distinct potions. He instructed Jasper and Shamous each to select whichever one struck their fancy and drink it. All of these potions came from new recipes he was experimenting with, and he was unsure what magical effects they would have. He assured the heroes that whatever the effects were, they wouldn't be harmful, and would likely only last for about an hour. Once they had each drank the entirety of the potion they selected, he would provide them with potions that would give them the shape of grippli for twenty four hours.

							Jasper chose a bronze potion that had a slight glow. This caused her to shrink down to half of her normal height, leaving her a little under a meter tall.

							Shamous selected a light blue potion with wisps of white. This caused him to transform into an aldruna. He took Jasper's backpack since she was now too small to carry it.

							Ribbert was true to his word, and provided the heroes with the promised potions. He gave them each another untested potion for being good sports about his experiment. He also suggested that Shamous could probably hold off on drinking his. Grippli typically feared and avoided outsiders, but made an exception for fey creatures (such as fairies or aldruna) due to their shared kinship with nature. Today was the first day of the grippli harvest festival, during which they usually entertained many strange fey guests.

							Jasper cleverly found a way to save her grippli potion too. All elves were descended from fey, and so had fey-like features. Between her elven features and the wings her mutations had given her, she could have almost passed for a fairy had she been smaller. Luckily, she knew a spell to address that. She cast the 'reduce' spell on herself, halving her height yet again.

							Now that the heroes were adequately disguised as fey, they instructed Zig to climb back into the backpack. They explained to the young kobold that she would have to keep her head down and remain in the backpack until they told her it was safe to come out again. With that sorted, they headed into Thistleton.

							Vibrantly colored tents, jaunty music, and the aroma of copious quantities of cooking food were waiting for the heroes inside the village. The festival was in full swing. The heroes were received as honored guests and given free rein within Thistleton. The party split up to cover ground more quickly.

							Vengeance was the first item on Shamous' to-do list. He wasn't over being murdered by an amphibian hit-squad during previous visit, and he was looking to return the favor. He recognized a grippli sitting alone at a table near a buffet as having been involved in his untimely passing. Shamous took a seat next to the grippli and decided to chat with him a bit before exacting his revenge. The grippli was severely intoxicated, but Shamous made an effort to hold a coherent conversation with him long enough to steer the conversation towards the time the frog helped murder him. It turned out Shamous' murder was precisely why the grippli had hit the mead so hard. He had blindly followed his goddess' orders to hunt down a seemingly innocent traveler. She had told him that it was because the traveler had stolen a sacred object, but he found no such artifact on his corpse afterwards. Grippli were normally a very peaceful folk, and the realization that he had helped to kill an innocent man had driven the tree-dwelling hunter to drown his sorrows. Upon seeing how thoroughly wracked by guilt the drunken frog was, Shamous decided to let go of his anger.

							Jasper wanted to get a head start on the investigation. Her smaller stature meant that her wings could now be used to fly instead of just gliding. She flew among some of the treetop houses and located the grippli's temple. She found the temple to be in stark contrast to the rest of the town. Inside, the priestesses openly wept for their missing queen. Jasper did her best to console the mourning clergy, and then set to work investigating the scene of the crime. She had come to understand that demigods, unlike the prime pantheon, could still be killed or overpowered by a strong enough foe. It was unlikely something that powerful would have been able to enter town unnoticed, so there were probably multiple assailants. It looked like the assailants more than likely dragged Gillywung north towards the coast. During her investigation, Jasper learned from the priestesses that the Council of Elders had recently begun entertaining the ideas set forth by an 'outside prophet'. One of the priestesses gave Jasper directions to the council building.

							Jasper and Shamous regrouped near the center of the festivities and agreed to pay a visit to the Council of Elders. Shamous removed the backpack containing Zig and carefully placed it at the base of a tree, just in case things went sideways with the council. He and Jasper quietly explained to Zig that they had to leave her there for a bit, but that they would be back for her as soon as possible.

							The heroes entered the council chambers and were met with a surprising sight. The Grippli elders sat on their mats, looking in quiet contemplation at four humans dressed in crimson robes. The humans stood equidistant around a carrot on a small table. Oddly, the carrot stood perfectly vertical instead of lying on its side. From context, the heroes realized the humans must have somehow related to the visiting prophet the grippli priestesses had mentioned. Before the heroes had a chance to fully take in the scene, the carrot turned around to face them. The orange ideological invader introduced himself as Pete, a representative of the Brotherhood of Matthias. He offered for the party to speak their piece to the elders, rather than wait for him to finish his speech.

							The party accepted the animated vegetable's offer and addressed the elders. Shamous explained that he and Jasper had come to Thistleton to obtain an ancient weapon of unrivaled power. He added that he and his associates were heroes on a quest to gather the weapons and save the world. Pete interrupted Shamous' petition and asked if he had correctly heard Shamous refer to himself and his comrades as heroes. Shamous confirmed that he had, which prompted an immediate response from the cultists. All four human cultists drew daggers and rushed the heroes, while the carrot began chanting an ominous incantation.

							Shamous decided to focus on Pete. He pushed his way through the robed cultists towards the carrot. He suffered several minor stabs during this reckless charge. While the wounds were small, Shamous would soon realize that the blades had been coated with a uniquely chaotic magical poison. Shamous grasped the carrot and carrot and ran for the exit.

							Jasper did her best to keep the cultists off of Shamous during his attempt to neutralize the magical carrot. Despite being less than half a meter tall during the fight, Jasper's combat prowess was still far above average. She managed to slay two of the cultists before sensing danger from behind.

							The grippli elders did not allow violence in their halls, and saw this sudden scuffle as a slight against their peaceful ways. They used powerful druidic magic to transform into bears, tigers, and other natural apex predators. The elders moved to force everyone, hero and cultist alike, out of their treetop sanctuary. Jasper observed this and decided to join Shamous in retreating to the exit. The two remaining cultists were not as quick to respond, and consequently were thrown off the porch of the building. They did not survive the fall.

							Once Shamous reached the exit, he snapped the carrot in two and ate it before using his druidic magic to transform into a giant eagle. Jasper followed only seconds behind, and the heroes made a beeline for the tree where they had left Zig. Zig remained safe inside the backpack, so Shamous grabbed its straps in his mighty talons and changed course for the edge of town. Jasper clung to the backpack to rest her wings and reassure Zig that Shamous was not going to eat her.

							The heroes made it only about halfway out of town before the poison in Shamous veins began to take effect. Shamous suddenly heard the distant sounds of vuvuzelas and felt a horrid rumbling in his stomach. The rumbling came to a head and Shamous involuntarily laid a large egg while still in flight. He dared not stop, but he circled once to see what transpired with the egg. The egg impacted on the ground and shattered, revealing some manner of creature that appeared to be constructed from felt. The creature immediately sprung to life and began to run erratically in all directions.

							The heroes safely escaped Thistleton without any other incidents. They realized that the potions they had drank would wear off any minute, and even if they didn't the elders would not be very receptive to them after seeing them commit violence in their council chambers. Shamous and Jasper decided to allow an hour or so for the elders to calm down. Once the hour was up, Jasper cast the Tiny Hut spell to create an impenetrable dome shaped shelter for Zig and provided her some snacks. Jasper and Shamous then drank their grippli disguise potions and returned to Thistleton.

							The heroes reentered the council building to find that the elders had calmed down considerably. Things went much more smoothly since there were no cultists around to interrupt. Shamous made his case to the elders, and vowed that he would stop at nothing to find their missing goddess if they saw fit to entrust him with the weapon. The elders seemed intrigued, but remained skeptical. The weapon was far too important to give to just anyone, so they proposed a challenge. Jasper and Shamous would be separated and given a trial in which to prove their strength of character. If both passed, the elders would grant them the artifact they sought. If either hero failed, both would be escorted out of the city. The heroes agreed to these terms.

							Jasper and Shamous were led into separate rooms wherein the grippli elders administered a series of inkblot tests. They carefully gauged each hero's responses to estimate their moral fiber and mental health. After careful consideration, the elders decided that both heroes were mentally sound and pure of heart. Kermin, the oldest and wisest of the elders, approached an exposed section of the tree around which the council chambers were constructed, and began to mumble an enchantment. The bark of the tree began to move and shift like waves upon water. The elder pulled an object wrapped in rags from the ripples of wood. He presented the item to Shamous, who accepted and bowed respectfully. Shamous carefully unwrapped the rags to reveal the Godfall Rapier.

							Kermin instructed Jasper and Shamous to kneel. With Gillywung missing, all of the royal duties fell to Kermin until she returned or a new queen was selected. As acting ruler of the grippli, Kermin knighted Jasper and Shamous. Unfortunately, most grippli have trouble differentiating human names, so the ceremony was more humorous than it was intended to be. With as much pomp and circumstance as he could muster, the wrinkly old frog dubbed the heroes Sir Jeffery (Jasper) The Bold and Sir Simon (Shamous) The Noble.

							The newly knighted heroes thanked the elders and left the council chambers. The festival was beginning to wind down, but music and free food was still abundant. The heroes took a few moments to resupply on provisions from the buffet tables before returning to Zig.

							After collecting Zig, the knights headed north to trace the steps of the creatures that abducted Gillywung. They caught the trail of a collection of robed humanoids heading east. Exhausted from the events of the day, the party made camp at the edge of the Forest of Life. During the night, Jasper spotted a one-man airship skiff approaching the Verdant Isle from the north. This skiff was promptly attacked by projectiles being hurled from a point somewhere else in the trees. The attack proved too much for the tiny vessel, and it soon crashed into the ground. The party elected to leave it until morning.

							Once morning arrived, the party set out eastward following the trail of the robed wanderers. This trail looped around and eventually led them to the wreckage of the skiff. The vessel had been robbed, and its kenku pilot lay dying on the ground next to it. Shamous was able to stabilize her. She introduced herself as Howler, a member of the guild Polyforce. With her ship already destroyed, she agreed to accompany the party on their search for the robed figures.

							Howler informed the party that she was attempting to find the rest of the party on orders from her guild leader. She was instructed to extend an invitation for them to join Polyforce, and inform them of its base of operations in the Tower of Renovamen at the base of the Moonfire Falls. Since kenku do not have voices of their own, Howler delivered the message in the voice of the guild leader. Shamous recognized the voice as Smith's. He quickly summarized the party's past dealings with Smith for Jasper, who had not met him.

							Secretly, Howler's message was particularly distressing for Jasper, for she knew the Tower of Renovamen all too well. The wizard who dwelled there cast a horrible spell that had turned her to stone, and she had spent the next five hundred years frozen as a result.

							Resuming the hunt led the party to the city of Okham. Okham was completely enclosed in a massive, seemingly indestructible, transparent dome with only one entrance. Entry was permitted only to those who demonstrated exceptional intelligence by passing an entrance exam, or those who had received a personal invitation from a registered citizen of the city.

							The heroes entered the entry chamber to the city, where they found a grumpy, elderly gnome on the other side of a transparent wall waiting to oversee exams for anyone hoping to enter the city. Howler decided to wait outside. Jasper, Shamous, and Zig underwent the exams, which they found to be exceptionally complex.

							Jasper was the first to complete her exam. She recognized her test as being a flawed blueprint for some sort of horseless vehicle that would travel along a rail system. She used the provided quill and ink to correct the blueprints, thus passing her exam. Jasper decided it would be cruel to explore the technologic wonders of the city without Shamous and Zig, so she declined to enter until they had finished their exams. The gnome collected a drop of Jasper's blood as a genetic sample, and added that to the city's records as a qualified visitor.

							Shamous and Zig were not as successful with their exams. Zig scored zero out of one hundred possible points. Shamous fared better, but still below the threshold required to enter the city. The gnome, still safely behind the impenetrable barrier, began to mock them quite viciously. "You're almost as bloody stupid as the robed twits I turned away earlier," he chortled. The heroes asked where the robed failures headed after their exams. The gnome told them he recalled seeing the robes head south.

							The party headed south after the robed figures. The heroes made excellent time, and located the robes en route to Vidan's Rest. They identified them as members of the Brotherhood of Matthias. The heroes learned through questioning that the cultists had come to the Verdant Isle only to spread the brotherhood's influence, and had nothing to do with Gillywung's disappearance.

							During the questioning, Howler let slip that the party were heroes. The cultists immediately became hostile and attacked the heroes. The heroes easily dispatched the ideological zealots. Zig even managed to kill one of them herself after he had been wounded by the more seasoned party members. She had apparently decided the cultists head would make a suitable lunch, so she severed it from his body. She offered Jasper and Shamous a bite of the severed head. They found this off-putting, but chalked it up to cultural differences and politely declined. Zig quickly picked the skull so clean that there was not a trace of organ or flesh anywhere to be found.

							Now that no leads remained in their investigation of Gillywung's disappearance, the party decided the time had come to return to Lagos and continue their search for the weapons. They made their way to the east coast of the Verdant Isle. Shortly before they planned to depart, the party was set upon by a much larger group of cultists, who had tracked the party down in order to exact vengeance. Before the cultists had a chance to begin their attack, everyone heard a familiar rumble. The stegosaurus riding kobold tribe came swiftly through the tree line, and mercilessly trampled the cultists to death. Zig pleaded with them not to trample the heroes. The tribal kobolds grudgingly agreed to forego murdering the party, out of respect for how well they had treated their youngest sister.

							Jasper and Shamous shared a heartfelt goodbye with Zig. Zig slowly turned and walked back towards her tribe. She stopped halfway as if she had just remembered something, and ran back to her new friends as quickly as her stumpy legs would carry her. She took the skull she still carried, and separated the lower jaw from the rest of the bone. She presented Jasper and Shamous each with one of the pieces of the skull, as a reminder of the first kill they shared. She rejoined her people, who helped her onto a stegosaurus and rode triumphantly into the sunset.

							Shamous channeled his druidic magic to become a giant eagle once more. Jasper and Howler climbed atop his feathery back, and the three of them departed for Lagos.


							Ancient Wisdom (03/30/2019)
							Party:
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Shamous Northunder

							META NOTE: The sessions from 03/16/19 and 03/23/19 took place simultaneously in-universe. However, Jasper and Shamous' mission took 1 day fewer than the rest of the party's mission. This supplemental mini-session caught up the timelines.

							Jasper, Shamous, and Howler safely reached the Temple of the Sacred Soul, a peaceful mountaintop monastery on western Lagos. The heroes accepted an offer of food and shelter from the local monks. Shamous found a secluded spot to meditate. During his meditation, he received a psychic message from Salax Dolv, elder of the kobold town of Wustebie. Salax asked Shamous to come to Wustebie alone, but revealed little else in his telepathic transmission.

							Shamous decided to comply with the elderly lizard's request. He informed Jasper and Howler that he would be traveling to Wustebie alone. He confirmed that both he and Jasper still had communications crystals so that they could regroup once Shamous' business was concluded. Shamous once again transformed into a giant eagle, and set out for Wustebie.

							The journey to Wustebie was pleasant and uneventful. Shamous landed beside Salax's home, reverted to his normal form, and entered. Salax had clearly been expecting him. He had already laid out a mat for Shamous to sit on, and placed a steaming cup of hot tea on a small table beside the mat. He invited Shamous to take a seat before divulging the reason he had asked him to come.

							Salax had been using divination magic to spy on Shamous ever since their first meeting. After seeing Shamous exercise selflessness and mercy when dealing with the tribe of frog-folk who had once slain him, Salax decided that Shamous could be trusted completely.

							With a newfound respect for Shamous, Salax offered up the Godfall Longsword, and charged Shamous with using it to its fullest. He also revealed that he was Sonya's (Shamous' dead wife) father. He confirmed that he was in fact not a kobold, but an ancient silver dragon wearing a magical disguise. He had witnessed the Godfall Council and its fallout with his own eyes, and took the longsword into his care when the council decided to hide the weapons. His oath to protect the weapon had kept him bound to Wustebie. Now that he had entrusted the weapon to a warrior worthy of its power, his oath was fulfilled. Salax asked only one more favor of Shamous; that he call upon Salax so that he might lend his aid during the final confrontation against The Rewera's forces.

							*****

							After parting ways with Shamous, Jasper asked Howler to take her to the headquarters of Polyforce. Howler eagerly agreed. She produced two acorns from her satchel and gave one to Jasper. Howler then placed her acorn on the ground, and dramatically mimed stomping it. Jasper took her meaning, and crushed the acorn Howler had given her with the heel of her boot. As soon as she did, she felt the familiar, disorienting whirl of teleportation magic.

							Then the magic subsided, Jasper found herself in a small room that seemed strangely familiar. She hear another whoosh of teleportation energy as Howler appeared behind her. The kenku walked through a doorway toward an ascending staircase, and gestured for Jasper to follow. The stairs led to an exceedingly well stocked wizard's study. A bullywug stood at a desk, casting enchantments upon acorns and other miscellaneous baubles. From context, Jasper recognized this as Smith. The bullywug expressed joy at seeing Howler safely returned, and greeted Jasper warmly. Howler gave Smith a summary of the events of her quest, and introduced Jasper as one of the heroes that Smith had sent her to locate. Smith thanked Howler, and dismissed her so that he could speak with Jasper alone.

							Smith explained that he had once been lucky enough to know a troupe of wandering heroes. They acted without hesitation to help those in need, with no thought toward compensation or reward. They were the type of people sung about in songs, and passed down in legend for generations. Smith was there when the heroes foiled a wicked plot from the vile sorcerer who once dwelt in this very tower. Unfortunately, the heroes disappeared without a trace during Lagos' hour of need. With his friends missing, Smith turned to new group of alleged heroes during the formation of Cross' pirate empire. The new adventurers proved to be immature, greedy, and prone to rash action. They failed to stop Cross' rise to power, and met a grisly fate in the process. Smith believed that this was due in part to their lack of heroic qualities. Those "heroes" were little more than mercenaries; certainly not the heroes Smith had hoped for.

							Smith founded Polyforce as a launch pad for future generations of heroes. His intention was to ensure that no matter what calamity arose, the world would never again be without proper heroes to combat it. A conflict greater than any the world had yet known loomed on the horizon, and the world needed heroes more than ever. Smith had been following the career of Jasper and her friends for several months now, and he believed they were exactly the caliber of heroes he was hoping for.

							He had spent a long time restoring the Tower of Renovamen, unlocking its secrets, and cataloguing the many powerful artifacts it contained. These instruments of evil would now serve as tools of good. He invited Jasper to explore the tower and its grounds, and to take any artifacts (within reason) she believed would aid her in the fight to come.

							During her exploration, Jasper stumbled upon an exquisite set of armor crafted from materials found only in the elemental plane of fire. The armor was exceptionally flexible and lightweight due to its construction, and the materials imbued the armor with magical properties that rendered the wearer impervious to fire and heat. Jasper replaced her worn plate-mail with the Fyr Chain.

							Jasper poked around long enough to confidently say that the guild was genuinely well intentioned. Once she was certain the tower was safe, she used her communication crystal to inform the other heroes and suggest that they regroup there. They agreed unanimously.


							Seeping Corruption (04/06/2019)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak

							Teomyr Thorsson
							Zenrya Fastfoot

							The heroes reunited at the Tower of Renovamen. They gathered in the grounds outside the tower, where they explained the events they had transpired during each of their journeys and recapped the events of their quest so far.

							Through the efforts of the heroes and their allies, they had secured the Godfall Dagger, Godfall Battleaxe, Godfall Wand, Godfall Spear, Godfall Trident, Godfall Reaping Chain, Godfall Rapier, and Godfall Longsword. They also knew that The Rewera held two of the weapons, though they could not be certain what those weapons were. This meant that the forces of good held eight of the weapons, the forces The Rewera held two, and two remained unaccounted for. The heroes were justifiably concerned about the two undiscovered weapons, but they believed that they would still be able to put up a respectable fight. Their current progress would allow for up to eight heroes to raise arms against The Rewera.

							The excursion to Grandcrest meant that the heroes also had two nearly complete Rewera Amulets, as well as The Rewera's notes detailing the activation process. If the heroes could complete the enchantments on the amulets, they would have a means of containing The Rewera's soul and putting a permanent end to his reign of terror.

							During the heroes' meeting, they noticed a modron observing them from a distance. They moved to approach the modron, but it disappeared in a beam of light. A few seconds passed, and the modron reappeared much nearer to the heroes, this time accompanied by four other modrons. The modrons explained that they had been sent bearing news from the gods. The life force of the demigod Ochiphe had been snuffed out, and The Rewera's life force felt stronger than ever before. The time between demigod executions suggested that The Rewera required time to properly digest each new soul he consumed, but it was likely only a matter of days or weeks before he was ready to absorb another. With each new soul absorbed, The Rewera's strength grew, and the chances of success withered.

							The modrons rode beams of light back to whence they came, and the heroes took a moment to process the information they had brought. They were uncertain what should be their next step, but they were certain that they could ill afford to waste time.

							Smith invited the heroes to inspect the many artifacts held within the tower and take what they thought they might need for the coming conflict. An intimidating looking set of armor caught Teomyr's eye. Smith warned that he had not managed to identify the magical properties of the armor yet, but Teomyr decided to take the risk. He donned the armor only to discover that it was cursed Demon Armor that could not be removed through normal means. The armor was sentient, and telepathically whispered suggestions to Teomyr as if it were a voice inside his head.

							Redji spent the bulk of his exploration in the library where Smith had set up his office. He noticed an ornate, seemingly broken clock atop Smith's desk. The clock was wound, but the hands were stuck at precisely 2:00. Redji sense a powerful magic aura from the clock, and asked Smith if he might have it to aid in the party's efforts. Smith declined, and said the clock was one of the few items that he would not be willing to part with. Redji respectfully refrained from any further questions about the clock, and turned his attention to the many books lining the shelves instead.

							He could hardly believe what he found upon the shelves. There were famous fairy tales that mentioned six ancient books blessed by the gods, each book tied to a different attribute. The stories stated that if someone were to read the entirety of one of these books, it would improve their being for the rest of their life, and the book would disappear from the world for a hundred years. Redji found that all six volumes sat upon the bookcase in front of him.

							Redji collected the tomes and located the other heroes. He anxiously explained the significance of the books, and the heroes divided them up amongst themselves based on the skills they already possessed. They discussed the merits of dividing the tomes based upon weaknesses versus the merits of dividing them based on strengths. If they were to distribute each tome to the hero most lacking in the corresponding ability, it would help to negate their weaknesses. Alternatively, if they distributed the tomes to the heroes whose strengths most closely matched the corresponding ability, it would make their strengths more powerful than ever. They ultimately decided to distribute the tomes based upon strength. Redji, the scholarly wizard, took the tome of intelligence. Bud, the spiritual druid, took the tome of wisdom. Namfoodle, the party's political face, took the tome of charisma. Jasper, the experienced soldier, took the tome of strength. Teomyr, the agile barbarian, took the tome of dexterity. Shamous, with his habit of taking blows for his comrades, took the tome of constitution.

							Once the heroes believed themselves to be properly outfitted for the final phases of their journey, they began to discuss the most viable courses of action available to them. Zenrya recalled a rumor she had heard from drunken sailors in a pub in Tilaporth. The rumors spoke of an island southwest of the continent of Peku that was not shown on any map. This island was said to have temples and a great monument unlike anything from any civilization. Namfoodle, Shamous, and Teomyr had all heard similar rumors. In the absence of any more promising leads, the heroes decided to seek out the alleged island…


							Desperate Measures (05/04/2019)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Shamous Northunder

							After days of flying over open ocean, Jasper's elf eyes spied a small island past the starboard bow. As the heroes' vessel drew closer, they noticed that the island was perfectly circular. The island was divided into nine circular sections by stone roads in the shape of rings; a large ring at the center of the island, and eight smaller rings which overlapped the edges of the large ring. At precisely the center of the large ring, a gargantuan pearl sat atop a monument that vaguely resembled the face of a clock. Of the eight outer rings, four contained forests, and four contained temples. The forests looked almost identical down to the tree placement, but were each frozen in a different season. Three of the four temples shared the exact same materials and floorplan, but were in different stages of construction. One appeared to still be under construction, one was complete and in good repair, and one was ravaged by age and entropy. The fourth temple was complete and in good repair, but had a different architectural style and was constructed with different materials.

							The heroes weighed anchor and walked ashore. By this time it was late afternoon, roughly 4:22pm. The heroes investigated the island a bit. They were unable to locate any intelligent life. They estimated the pearl in the center of the island to be at least twenty five feet in diameter. They inspected the temples more closely, and found that each was marked by a plaque written in the celestial tongue. The incomplete temple was labeled "What Was". The completed temple was labeled "What Is". The ruined temple was labeled "What Will Be". The abnormal temple was labeled "What Might Have Been". They refrained from entering the temples, out of understandable paranoia. Bud noticed a strange species of mushroom that grew around the temples. This wasn't inherently noteworthy, but it appeared that some of the mushrooms had been picked recently.

							The heroes heard movement from the bushes in one of the forest rings. Heroes with sharper hearing estimated the sound to have come from something comparable in size to a human. Still paranoid, the heroes gathered near the giant pearl to debate how to approach the situation. Jasper became tired of the discussion after it dragged on for several minutes. She sent Wesley, her weasel familiar, into the bushes where the noise had originated. She used her psychic connection to see through Wesley's eyes, and quickly discovered the source of the sound. A dwarf sized humanoid that closely resembled a badger had been quietly observing the heroes from within the bushes.

							Jasper decided that this must have been one of the indigenous people of the island. She called out to the creature as non-threateningly as she could manage. The creature scurried toward a nearby hole, and yelled something into it. The creature then moved to the tree line nearest the party and called out to them in what seemed to be a hybrid of the celestial and terran languages. "Ko koe ma re ranei celu?" he shouted. Thankfully, Bud was fluent in celestial, Redji was fluent in terran, and Jasper was fluent in both. The question seemed to contain some proper nouns, but the heroes understood that the question translated roughly as "Are you Mare or Celu?" After a bit of deliberation, the heroes replied that they didn't understand the question. The creature replied by asking the same question again. This went on for a few minutes, after which seven more creatures emerged from the hole the first one had shouted into earlier. Four of the recent arrivals remained near the hole, seemingly on guard. The remaining three approached the party.

							The heroes got the impression that one of the approaching badgers was some sort of diplomat, and the other two were his bodyguards. This was not far from the truth. The badger diplomat began by asking the same question as the first badger, albeit in a much calmer, friendlier tone. The party once more replied that they didn't understand the question. The badger diplomat smiled and repeated the question. "Are you Mare?" he said, gesturing towards the sea, "or Celu?" he continued, gesturing towards the sky. The heroes took his meaning, and replied that they were "Celu". After a quick glance at Redji's transparent skin and Jasper's feathered wings, the diplomat seemed satisfied with their answer. The diplomat turned back toward his people and loudly proclaimed that the heroes were "Celu". This prompted an almost instant shift in the other badgers, who now seemed considerably more at ease.

							With the badgers' burning question answered, the diplomat moved on to other topics. He explained that he was called Maestru Francescu, and that his people were "Brokkos", a type of "Tarra". The two guards that had followed the diplomatic Brokkos were assigned to look after the heroes. The heroes found the Brokkos to be a surprisingly friendly, civilized, and forthcoming people.

							Through continued conversation, the heroes learned more about the Brokkos' culture and beliefs. The Brokkos believed that the island was the only land in the world, and that the rest of the world was covered in ocean. They also believed that all life fell into one of three categories: Celu, Mare, or Tarra. Tarra creatures came from the earth and were generally good. Mare creatures came from the sea and were universally evil. Celu creatures came from the sky and were neutral.

							The heroes asked Maestru Francescu about the purpose of the temples. He explained that the temple of "What Was" allowed the Brokkos to travel to the time of their ancestors. The temple of "What Will Be" led to the time of their descendants, but it was strictly forbidden to enter. The temple of "What Might Have Been" led to alternate timelines, where branching points in history caused the world to develop differently. The Brokkos often utilized this temple for entertainment or to prove their strength by fighting monsters from other worlds. The temple of "What Is" was anchored to this timeline, and so could be used to return after entering the temple of "What Might Have Been".

							The party was excited by the prospect of time travel, and quickly decided to enter the temple of "What Was". Their guides accompanied them, and introduced them to the Brokkos of the past to ensure that they did not react violently to the presence of the heroes.

							Redji was able to utilize his time magic to determine that the temples caused time displacement in increments of one thousand years. They had traveled exactly one thousand years back in time, and walking through the temple labeled "What Will Be" would send them one thousand years forward to their original time period.

							The temples were in different states during this time period. It appeared as if all of them were in an earlier stage of construction than in the party's original time period.

							The party took some time to discuss how they might use the temples to gain some advantage in their fight against The Rewera. They were unable to reach a consensus on how best to use the temples, so the heroes split into two groups.

							*****

							Namfoodle and Redji decided to remain in the past. Namfoodle asked that their two guides, Guardia Lucia and Guardia Angiolina, remain with the other party members. Once the guides and the other heroes had returned to the present, Namfoodle and Redji set to work on their schemes.

							Redji traveled another 1,000 years into the past and left a mark on the temple labeled "What Is". This is visible in the present, although he was unable to verify this personally from his position in time. Redji noted that in this era, all of the temples looked as if construction had scarcely begun. Despite this, Redji traveled another 1,000 years backwards. Unfortunately, this placed him prior to the construction of the time-gates, leaving him stranded 3,000 years in the past.

							Namfoodle stayed at his current position in time, and asked to be brought before the Brokkos' chiefest spiritual leaders. The Brokkos complied, and led Namfoodle to a chamber deep within their underground city of winding tunnels. Namfoodle told the spiritual leaders that he was a prophet of Tarra, sent to guide them. This did not go according to plan. The spiritual leaders quickly decided that he was either a false prophet or a demon of Mare. They bound him and began to make preparations to burn him at the stake.

							*****

							Bud, Jasper, Shamous, and the two Brokkos guides returned to their original time period.

							The heroes tactfully asked why the Brokkos were so afraid of the water. Their guides explained that the ocean was home to evil creatures that ruthlessly attacked anything that entered the water. Upon hearing this, Bud decided he wanted to see for himself. He wandered into the shallows and found that they abruptly turned into a steep drop off around ten meters from shore. He leaned over the edge and saw several dozen creatures rapidly moving towards him. The creatures resembled large alligators, but had translucent flesh and six insect-like legs. The sight was interrupted by a sudden tug as Guardia Angiolina dragged Bud back to shore. She lightly scolded him and explained that the water was dangerous. Bud found the fuzzy creature's overprotectiveness endearing, and hugged her. This ordinarily would have resulted in a wicked mauling, but he rolled very well on his charisma check.

							Curious as to how anyone could stay sane on such a tiny island, Bud asked what the Brokkos like to do for fun. Guardia Lucia explained that the Brokkos liked to eat the slightly hallucinogenic mushrooms that grew near the temples, and then venture into the temple of "What Might Have Been". The heroes decided that sounded entertaining, and began organizing a group of Brokkos to engage in a mushroom run with. Their guides politely declined, explaining that they were still on duty. The heroes were able to recruit two nearby off-duty Brokkos. The multiverse explorers each ate a handful of mushrooms and entered the temple.

							Bud emerged in a world where the island was inhabited by sirens instead of Brokkos. The sirens spotted Bud and attempted to bewitch him with their voices. He was too strong of will to be lured by their song, and returned to his original reality without issue.

							Jasper was sent to a realm ruled by dryads. She exchanged a friendly greeting with one, and then returned to her original reality.

							Shamous was sent to a twisted fey realm, and was immediately attacked by a demented creature known as a "Redcap". He retreated back through the gate with the Redcap still clinging to his shell. The rest of the party was able to aid Shamous in disposing of the Redcap before it killed him.

							Of the Brokkos, one did not return. Another returned eating the remains of a freshly slain Yuan-Ti Malison (terrifying 8' tall snake monster).

							By this time the heroes began to find it concerning that there had been no word from Namfoodle or Redji. They regrouped with Guardia Angiolina and Guardia Lucia and traveled back to the past. They arrived only to find Namfoodle tied to a post, and a mob of Brokkos building a bonfire underneath him.

							Jasper decided this was as good a time as any to drink the remaining untested potion she received from Ribbert. This turned out to be a potion that temporarily magically enhanced the user's persuasiveness. Sensing this, she approached the lynch mob. She told the angry Brokkos that Namfoodle had several severe learning disabilities, and could not be held accountable for his actions. She went on to suggest that executing a mentally disabled person would bring only shame and dishonor. The Brokkos agreed with that line of reasoning, and freed Namfoodle.

							The heroes thanked the past Brokkos for their mercy, and returned once more to their original era having successfully rescued Namfoodle. Unfortunately, Redji remained beyond their power to rescue…

							Redji evaluated every tool at his disposal for a way to rejoin his allies in the present, but came up empty-handed. Just when it seemed that all hope was lost, he received an unexpected visitor. Chromus, god of time, manifested in front of the giant pearl. He seemed uncharacteristically melancholy. He waited for Redji to approach and then began to spout exposition.

							Chromus revealed that the island on which they now stood was, in a metaphorical sense, his own grave. The timeline of the cosmology was circular, with existence beginning again immediately after it ends. The Rewera had been almost successful in his conquest in all of the previous cycles. However, each conquest had ended on that island with a final confrontation between The Rewera and Chromus. Each time, Chromus had used his dying breaths to reset time for the cosmology, beginning the cycle anew. 

							Chromus could not actually see the future, but he had observed the lifelines of his previous incarnations. Having seen all of existence play out seventy three times had left him quite practiced at predicting the outcome of current events.
							Each cycle gave rise to powerful entities. In their hubris, they would push the boundaries of magic in an effort to become even more powerful. This careless disregard for the natural laws weakened the boundaries between cosmologies, allowing pieces of other universes to bleed through. These boundaries grew weaker with every cycle.

							While Chromus held the reins of time in this cosmology, the others were beyond his sight, and were controlled by other pantheons. Because of this, those universes were unaffected by Chromus' timeline resets. Consequently, other cosmologies advanced normally while Chromus' was doomed to repeat itself every few thousand years.  Chromus used to be content with this cyclical reality, but the other cosmologies had become too large an unknown to safely predict the future. Based on his previous cycles, Chromus believed that the seventy fourth cycle was near its end. He feared there would not be a seventy fifth.

							As much as Chromus detested manipulating time, he feared the end of reality far more. Determined to prevent the collapse of his cosmology, he returned Redji to the present. He also transported Teomyr and Zenrya from the continent of Lagos to Noseyus Isle to join the rest of the party.

							Chromus gathered the heroes, and informed them that there were only four to six days before the end of the universe. In light of the circumstances, he would bend his laws against timeline manipulation to give the heroes one final boon. He would send them each seven days into the past to a location of their choosing, so that they could make final preparations for end. He went on to explain that the heroes would need to plan their week carefully so that they did not create a paradox by encountering or hindering their past selves. Chromus would monitor the timelines of the heroes during their preparation and keep a list of any allies they enlisted. At the end of the seven days, he would reunite the heroes at any rendezvous point they required.

							After being reunited, the heroes would have three additional days to spend however they saw fit. At sundown on the final day, Chromus would teleport the heroes and their allies to the location where they would begin their assault on the forces of Hel.

							The heroes asked to be reunited at the Tower of Renovamen at the end of their week. The party members wisely chose to separate to diversify their preparations by traveling separately. Redji summoned the extra-dimensional chest where he stored the party's funds, and distributed the money to its rightful owners. They took great care to plan their week around their previous actions, and then informed Chromus of the locations where they wished to begin. The world faded to white around the heroes, and they each awakened at precisely 8:00 am at their chosen locations.

							1st Day:  Bud arrived at the city of Amarillo. He met with Pehr Lim and negotiated an alliance against The Rewera. Lim agreed to help in exchange for custody of the fiend that killed his brother. Afterwards, Bud flew to Budopolis to ready his people for the coming battle.

							2nd Day: Bud flew to the industrial city of Grinford to evaluate the possibility commissioning an army of mechanical war machines. There he met a gifted inventor named Ricard, who offered to prototype a construct army in exchange for certain... trade goods. Bud and Ricard departed for Rickard's laboratory in Okham to discuss the deal in greater detail.

							3rd Day: Bud and Ricard arrived in Okham. They finalized the negotiations for designing the mechanical soldiers, and began initial development.

							4th Day: Bud remained in Okham and provided input for the prototype.

							5th Day: Bud settled on a final design for the war machines. Ricard sent the order to Grinford for mass production.

							6th Day: Bud traveled from Okham to the nearby city of Acfirth, where he campaigned for recruits. He managed to convince around six hundred citizens to join the cause.

							7th Day: Bud traveled to Grinford to oversee production of his mechanical army.

							*****
							Jasper

							1st Day: Jasper recalled hearing a surprisingly plausible rumor that the Thunder Plains were inhabited by fearsome beasts, so she selected that as her destination. Jasper arrived in the Thunder Plains with roughly six hours remaining before the potion that enhanced her persuasiveness wore off. She found a battalion of large humanoids resembling hippopotamus. She learned that these creatures were called Kivt, and that they enjoyed war so much that they regularly involved themselves in other peoples' wars solely to share in the violence. She discovered that the constant blasts for which the Thunder Plains were named were caused by their weapon tests. Jasper negotiated a contract for the Kivt's services. The Kivt agreed to participate, but would only accept payment in the form of explosives/weaponry of an acceptable quality. They boarded the Kivt's sluggish troop transport airship and departed for Stonweald in order to evaluate potential payment methods.

							2nd Day: Jasper and the Kivt arrived in Stonweald. The locals were not pleased that the Kivt were in their city, but were too intimidated by them to do anything about it. Jasper learned that Teomyr was also in Stonweald, and that he had become engaged. She made arrangements for best blacksmiths in the city to give demonstrations of their wares to the Kivt, and attended Teomyr's bachelor party. The Kivt deemed all the local options for payment unacceptable. Jasper and the Kivt departed for Amarillo to present other payment options.

							3rd Day: Continued to sail for Amarillo.

							4th Day: Continued to sail for Amarillo.

							5th Day: They arrived in Amarillo before the sun. Jasper took the Kivt to Cog and Sprocket to demonstrate some of the store's more deadly merchandise. The Kivt were pleased. Jasper convinced the Kivt to sail with her to the Firelake.

							6th Day: They arrived at the Firelake. Jasper slew the Firenewt Zaienen in single combat, technically earning the throne. However, the newts were unwilling to accept another outsider as leader after Namfoodle's immediate abandonment of the position. Jasper used a combination of magic, deception, and fire immunity from her Fyr Armor to convince the Firenewts that she was a goddess of fire. The Firenewts readily accepted her rule after that.

							7th Day: Jasper continued to cement her position as leader of the Firenewts.

							*****
							Namfoodle

							1st Day: Namfoodle arrived on the mysterious, unexplored continent of Peku. He stumbled upon a tribe of bearfolk. Used a spell to enable communication with them, and asked to be brought before their leader. The bears led Namfoodle on a lengthy trek to their high council.

							2nd Day: Namfoodle arrived and met with the bear council, who incorrectly associated him with the fire elementals that had been terrorizing the local wild-life. They sentenced him to banishment within the active volcano in the center of the island.

							3rd Day: Namfoodle's assigned guards began the journey to the volcano. Namfoodle observed that the volcano seemed to be permanently erupting. Namfoodle managed to convince his guards of his innocence. They agreed to take him to another village's council for a re-trial, and began heading east.

							4th Day: The bear guards brought Namfoodle to a village were sentient apes lived under the protection of benevolent Ents. They presented him to the local Treant council. The Ents agreed to help with the coming war, in exchange for assistance dealing with the fire elemental infestation.

							5th Day: Namfoodle and his entourage ventured northward, so that he could assess the strength of the fire elementals.

							6th Day: Namfoodle continued to travel north. As he drew closer to the volcano, he observed that the lava appeared to flowing upwards into the volcano, instead of downwards out of it.

							7th Day: Namfoodle ventured far enough north to see the Blighted Hills, where he encountered an Oni (a particularly violent, crafty type of demon). He evaded the Oni, but took this as a sign that dealing with the infestation would be a larger task than he had first imagined. He decided it would be best to uphold his end of the Ents' bargain after the war, when he could return with reinforcements.

							*****
							Redji

							1st Day: Redji arrived aboard The Retaliator, Cross' flying fortress. Cross was amused that the wizard had the audacity to teleport aboard his ship, and agreed to meet with him. Redji successfully negotiated a temporary alliance with Cross, who agreed to lead his armada into battle against The Rewera.

							2nd Day: Redji pored over ancient texts, looking for anything that might give the heroes an advantage.

							3rd Day: Redji studied his best offensive magic and prepared the ingredients for his most potent spells.

							4th Day: Redji studied his best offensive magic and prepared the ingredients for his most potent spells.

							5th Day: Redji studied his best offensive magic and prepared the ingredients for his most potent spells.

							6th Day: Redji studied his best offensive magic and prepared the ingredients for his most potent spells.

							7th Day: Redji studied his best offensive magic and prepared the ingredients for his most potent spells.

							*****
							Shamous

							1st Day: Shamous traveled to the monster hunter academy in the city of Victarn. He encountered a gifted but incredibly cocky student named Wolfstan Slater, who agreed to take him to the headmaster. Shamous convinced the headmaster, Mr. Pennington, of the incoming threat. He agreed to lead his students into battle against The Rewera. Shamous borrowed an airship and Wolfstan, and departed for Wustebie. They arrived in Wustebie at roughly 7:30 pm. There he informed Salax of the coming battle. Shamous and Wolfstan set sail for Bravagg Isle.

							2nd Day: Shamous arrived on the western coast of Bravagg at roughly 9:30 am. He scouted the curiously flat top of Bravagg Mountain while en route to eastern side of island. Shamous located a city of dragonborn on the eastern side of the island at roughly 6:30 pm. He disembarked a few miles outside of town, and left Wolfstan to watch the ship. Thanks to the reptilian body Shamous received during his last reincarnation, the dragonborn citizens were happy to answer Shamous' questions about the mountain. Shamous boarded the airship and headed back toward the mountain. Using the new information he gained from the town, he was able to locate an entrance to the mountain.

							3rd Day: Shamous entered mountain. He found it to be a massive community of dragons, sectioned off into smaller states based on color and climate. He observed that the dragons seemed to be able to coexist here, even though it was well known that most of the lineages present would kill each other without a second though. He spoke to some of the mountain's citizens and learned that the peace was enforced by the three-headed, ancient void dragon for which the island was named. Bravagg made its lair dead-center of the mountain, atop the petrified remains of an ancient titan. Shamous made the lengthy hike to Bravagg's lair, and made a plea for his people to join the fight. The ancient beast cared not about the fate of the universe. It explained that if the universe were to come to an end, the dragon would simply find a new universe in which to dwell. However, some of the other dragons were swayed by Shamous' words. Dozens of dragons pledged their aid in staving off the apocalypse.

							4th Day: Shamous and Wolfstan set sail for Thistleton.

							5th Day: Shamous continued to sail for Thistleton.

							6th Day: Shamous arrived in Thistleton. He consulted with the Council of Elders and persuaded them to join the assault on The Rewera.

							7th Day: Shamous made certain that he was properly equipped and prepared for the coming battle.

							*****
							Teomyr

							1st Day: Teomyr arrived in the city state of Stonweald and arranged to meet with King Harbek Stonespire IV. Teomyr described the adventures the party had experienced so far. He explained the Godfall artifacts, and the coming battle. The king had heard of the party's heroic triumphs, and took a liking to Teomyr's brashness. He revealed that his family had been the keepers of the Godfall Halberd for generations. The king went on to explain that he would be willing to pledge his armies, and even give Teomyr the halberd on one condition.

							King Harbek Stonespire IV was a widower with nine adult children. He was eager to marry some of them off to high-profile outsiders to bolster his nation and forge lasting alliances. He wanted Teomyr to marry one of them. The oldest two were already married, but Teomyr could take his pick between the other seven. The king made his unmarried children line up for Teomyr's inspection. Teomyr became engaged to Riswynn, the oldest of Harbek's unmarried children, so that he could be as close to the throne as possible.

							2nd Day: Teomyr remained in Stonweald while preparations were made for the wedding. He found Jasper in town leading an army of Kivt, and told her of his engagement. Teomyr had a bachelor party with Jasper and several of the bride's brothers.

							3rd Day: Teomyr and Riswynn were wed in an extravagant ceremony. The retired to her royal suite where they consummated the marriage. Unbeknownst to either of them, this would result in twins.

							4th Day: Teomyr and Riswynn enjoyed a brief honeymoon.

							5th Day: Teomyr began training with the Stonweald army in preparation for the coming battle.

							6th Day: Teomyr continued training with the Stonweald army.

							7th Day: Teomyr continued training with the Stonweald army.

							*****
							Zenrya

							1st Day: Zenrya chose to investigate rumors of a civilization of intelligent fungi located in the shadows of the mountains in Decapos. She arrived at the village of Eyesbane and began her search.

							2nd Day:  Zenrya located a tribe of the rumored fungi-folk, known as Enoki. Despite their intimidating appearance, they proved to be largely benevolent. They were easily swayed to the cause. Zenrya ventured further into Decapos to recruit further Enoki tribes to the resistance.

							3rd Day: Zenrya continued to search for Enoki tribes.

							4th Day: Zenrya continued to search for Enoki tribes.

							5th Day: Zenrya continued to search for Enoki tribes.

							*****
							The heroes were reunited at the Tower of Renovamen. They used the three remaining days before the battle to prepare themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally.


							Here Be Dragons (06/14/2019)
							Party:
							Shamous Northunder

							The individual who played Shamous had to leave during the previous session due to a family emergency. This session allowed him to finish Shamous' time-traveling week of preparations.


							Storming the Gates (06/15/2019)
							Party:
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Shamous Northunder
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Bud Smoak

							META NOTE: This and the subsequent session happened roughly concurrently in the narrative. This session focused on the efforts of the party's allies during the final conflict. I prepared a stack of character sheets to represent several of the of the more prominent allies the heroes had made, and allowed the players each to choose one of their allies to play as during this session. When one of these allies fell (which happened frequently), they were allowed to select another character sheet from the stack.

							The appointed time had come. Chromus and the other gods used their divine powers to bring the heroes and all their allies to a large, open field.

							Everyone was made to understand the role they would play in the battle to come. Those who held the Godfall Weapons would head for the throne of Hel, where The Rewera would doubtless be waiting. The gods, demigods, and everyone else would engage the forces of Hel head on to clear a path for the heroes. The gods went on to explain that while they would be as mortals inside the domain of death, they had taken precautions to ensure that if they should fall, their magic would continue to function for any warriors who normally relied on it.

							The battle would not be an easy one. As the god of death, The Rewera held sway over the souls of the departed. It was likely he would force them to fight for him. These damned souls would be accompanied by hundreds of demons, including The Generals of Hel, the chiefest of all the demons. The Generals of Hel served as a conduit for the god of death. If they could be slain, The Rewera's control of the souls of the dead would be weakened. It was possible that this would create an opening for Vidan, god of life, to restore free will to some of the dead. If this were to occur, it was likely the freed souls would take up arms against their cruel masters.

							Now that everyone was up to speed, the gods opened a gate large enough for the vast armies to enter. The gods, the heroes, and their allies all charged valiantly into the domain of death.

							As the armies of light found that The Rewera had been expected them, and had already made preparations for their arrival. The armies of darkness were already entrenched at the gate, ready to defend their wretched master. Large enchanted crystals sat atop columns distributed throughout Hel, and served as conduits to channel the souls of any gods that fell in battle into an amulet for The Rewera to absorb later.

							As predicted, The Rewera made the souls of the departed to fight for him. This, in addition to his many demon servants, made for an overwhelming resistance. Regardless, the forces of light fought unwaveringly to preserve their fragile existence. The heroes' allies suffered heavy casualties, but managed to carve a path to the throne room, slaying the Generals of Hel in the process. With each general that fell, Vidan was able to restore free will and thought to another portion of the dead. This caused the tide of battle to slowly turn favor of the forces of light.

							All the heroes' allies could do now was hold the dark armies of Hel at bay. They continued to fight with all their strength, knowing that the fate of the universe hinged on the success of the heroes…


							Wrath of Rewera (A New Dawn) (07/13/2019)
							Party:
							Bud Smoak
							Jasper Nightbreeze
							Namfoodle Daergel
							Redji Cloudtaker
							Shamous Northunder
							Teomyr Thorsson

							The heroes arrived in the throne room of Hel, and found The Rewera waiting for them. He floated ominously above his throne, which sat in front of a massive, black gem. He wasted absolutely no time in hurling a volley of devastatingly powerful magic in their direction. Fortunately, thanks to their careful preparations and their years of adventuring experience, the heroes were prepared for this. They deftly avoided the worst of the dark god's onslaught.

							After a ferocious battle, the heroes managed to defeat what they thought to be The Rewera. He drew his last breath, and melted into a pile of snow. The heroes recognized this to mean that what they had defeated was in fact a simulacrum; a magical duplicate used as an assistant or decoy. As the snowy remains of the simulacrum melted away, the massive black gem behind the throne began to tremble and crack. It burst open to reveal a large, black dragon.

							The dragon emitted a piercing roar before viciously attacking the heroes. The heroes were already tired from the previous fight, but still managed to hold their own against the beast. As the increasingly exhausted heroes slew the dragon, The Rewera's last failsafe revealed itself. He had merely used magic to temporarily assume the form of a dragon. As with most shape-changing magic, slaying the disguised form merely forced the user back to their original form, at exactly the state it was before they had cast the spell. This meant that the true Rewera now stood before them, none the worse for wear.

							With no more contingency plans and nowhere to run, The Rewera fought like a cornered animal. Eventually, the utterly exhausted heroes managed to dispatch the horrid usurper once and for all. One of the amulets the heroes had finished captured his soul as it escaped his mangled body.

							Someone would need to absorb this soul and take the throne of Hel in order to call off its armies. After a very brief discussion, Namfoodle was selected to shoulder this responsibility. He absorbed the soul of The Rewera and became the new god of death. He used his newly attained authority to order the armies of Hel to stand down.

							The conflict was finally over. The heroes had successfully put an end to the threat that loomed over their world. As a thank you gift, Vidan agreed to restore life to any willing souls that had fallen in the battle, or because of The Rewera's actions within the last few years.

							However, as with all wars, victory still extracted a heavy toll. Graisum, Larazi, and Chromus fell during the battle. Their souls had been captured and placed into amulets by the conduits The Rewera had constructed. These souls would need to be absorbed, for a world without harvests, law, or time would scarcely be a world at all.

							Bud became the new god of the harvest.

							Falimur, who had been restored to life as part of Vidan's gift, became the new god of law.

							Redji declined to become the new god of time, and instead chose to seek out and select a worthy person to inherit the title.
