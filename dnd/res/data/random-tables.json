			"You wake up on a throne wearing a crown of twigs, surrounding you are 30 sleeping goblins.",
			"You cracked a tooth. There is a hunk of metal in your pocket with a set of tooth indentations in it. It was a piece of jewelry worth 1d100gp, now it is somewhat devalued.",
			"A potion sits on your nightstand as you awake. It is labeled drink me!",
			"A familiar waits at your bedside for you to wake, and refuses to leave your side. You have gained a new/additional (if you already owned one) familiar. See the list of 100 familiars to roll what familiar it is.",
			"You wake up in a bed. Floating in the middle of a murky pond. You can see your gear at the edge of the pond 100 meters away. You also see a large shadow swimming beneath the surface of the pond.",
			"You find a holy book in the dresser drawer of your inn room. On the very first page hastily scrawled is the innkeeper is a vampire, with a splatter of blood next to it. The innkeeper is not a vampire.",
			"You wake up in a bed. Your belongings are on the nightstand next to it. You’re surrounded by dense forest in all directions.",
			"You awake in a regular looking tavern room with a note taped to you, it reads: Beware of mimics. You notice your pack with all your belongings on the floor beside the bed. The door is the mimic.",
			"You stayed up all night. You are very sleepy.",
			"You wake up snuggled up with an ogre in a jail cell, and a massive headache. You’ve arrested for disorderly conduct and ordered to sleep off your inebriated state in jail. The guard comes up to the cell door, chuckling to himself as opens it up to let you out. He shows you a contract you’ve signed, in which you promised the ogre named Gutsplitter that you would bring him home to his mountain.",
			"You wake up face down in a nest of giant centipedes, surrounded by mountains of copper coins.",
			"You wake up in a strange gold room, with diamonds and coins the size of your entire body. You suddenly feel the entire room jostle upwards, and a dreaded feeling of vertigo overcomes you. You realize it’s not the coins and diamonds that are big… You’re the one that’s smaller!",
			"You wake up in the temple of town, with a grumpy old priest dabbing down your forehead as he mumbles things about the ‘youth of these days, not knowing when to stop!’",
			"You wake up on top of the enormous statue of the king, in the middle of the square, with your underwear wearing on your head. There’s green paint all over your hands, and when you look down you see people pointing at you and the king’s ass in utter shock.",
			"You wake up on a cold stone table; your naked body shakes from the icy touch. As you begin to get up a sharp pain comes over your chest. You ever so slowly shift and lift yourself up and as you look down you see there is now a long, red, thick scar over where your heart is. You look around the room and see demonic runes, bones, tiki torches and that the walls of this room are the sides of a small cave. The exit to the cave is just ahead, you spot your items there in a pile, the light of the early morning is just beginning to pierce the cloudy sky. Something sinister happened last night; you pray it will not come back to haunt you.",
			"You wake up & realize that half your gear is missing. In your hand is a crumpled piece of paper with a badly drawn treasure map on it.",
			"You may have lost the drinking contest, but you have gained the respect of a dwarven adventuring party",
			"You overhear some other patrons at the tavern plotting a crime. Join them, stop them, call the city guard, or It’s none of your business.",
			"The next day 3 people start fighting over you. They seem to be arguing over which one saw you first & the promises you made last night.",
			"You wake up under a tree at the outskirts of town. There is a person next to you. They gently place a finger under your chin to tilt your head so you’re eye to eye. Then in a very calm voice they say ‘challenge accepted’. Without another word they wander into the woods. A minute later, you see a dragon take flight, flying away from the town.",
			"You wake up in a summoning circle, surrounded by robed figures. The apparent leader shouts ‘All hail lord Azzagogth’.",
			"You feel a slap on your face. ‘Hey! Wake up and focus! It’s go time. The boss is about to blow the doors. Go go go!’",
			"A faint breeze caresses your naked buttocks as you try to figure out how to untie yourself from the flagpole.",
			"You wake up yesterday.",
			"You wake in the sewers, sitting upon an over-sized and terribly shoddily made throne, with a tribe of Kobolds bowing and supplicating before you. Somehow, you’ve become Kobold Royalty.",
			"You wake to the sounds of a high-pitched voice reciting a list of your failures. Upon inspection, the voice is coming from a copper bracelet (which has a beautiful green patina). Turns out you lost a game of chance at a local tavern, and this sentient item was transferred to you. It’s only function is to loudly and incessantly speak upon your failures (which it knows all of).",
			"You wake up face down on the street, just outside where you are staying. You don’t know how long you’ve been sleeping on your arms but both of them have gone to sleep entirely and you cannot manipulate either, only swing them limply.",
			"You wake up to find the wife/husband of a very important mob boss in bed with you. You suddenly hear heavy pounding on the door, telling you to unlock it at once!",
			"You wake up on a cold marble slab surrounded by candles with two men in robes standing vigilant over you.",
			"You wake up on the floor of what seems to be a kennel surrounded by snoring war dogs.",
			"You wake up with a headache, but everything else seems in order (DC perception check to notice if a magical item of your was replaced with a mundane replica).",
			"You wake up in the Underdark, somehow.",
			"You wake up and find that you have a powerful curse on you. Turns out you cursed out a wizard last night, which in hindsight was probably a bad move.",
			"You wake up in a bed that isn’t yours in a town you’ve never heard of. Apparently, you seduced a wealthy aristocrat who took you back to their mansion. They were also very drunk, and might need to dispel a scandal with you at the center.",
			"You wake up to the other side of your bed empty, as well as all your stuff gone, including your clothes. Leaving the inn, you begin to see a trail of your things leading to the town fountain, where the rest of your things lay soaked at the bottom of the fountain.",
			"You wake up in the pigpen of a farm 6 hours away from the place you were carousing.",
			"You wake up with 1d6 more tattoos than you had before.",
			"You wake up with a new magic item. Its original owner will want it back.",
			"Everything seems fine until you open your backpack and discover someone’s complete skeleton inside.",
			"Your favorite weapon has been switched with a very similar one, likely grabbed by mistake. The name of the real owner is on the handle.",
			"A strange, ethereal figure stands above you as you wake. It says “thank you for all that you have done for us” and vanishes with no further explanation.",
			"You awake naked in the tavern broom closet cuddling the owner’s dog.",
			"You awake in an attic, the resident of which, a rather lonely ghost, you have apparently befriended.",
			"You awake missing a prized/sentimental possession; gambled away in a street game where it has since been traded many more times.",
			"You awake in a strange house, chained to the bed. Someone comes in and feeds you breakfast with an adoring, unbreaking stare. It seems you’ve won an admirer.",
			"You awake at the bottom of a ravine, covered in what smells like duck fat. Scavengers circle overhead.",
			"You wake up on a boat on a foggy stretch of water, you are wrapped tightly in canvas that has been stitched closed. Your feet are tied together to a large-ish rock.",
			"You wake up with the skin below your waist, between your legs (if you have legs) red, swollen and blistered. Your speed is halved for three days.",
			"You wake up covered in what you can only assume is fox-urine, and covered in bloody chicken feathers.",
			"You wake up missing your favorite tooth, two black eyes, a broken nose, and possibly one or more broken ribs.",
			"A short while later you find a slightly battered, scented, high quality paper card attached by a string to a small, finely wrought, ornate key. On the card, in embossed lettering, is the name and address of a wealthy person, as well as a handwritten phrase, in excellent penmanship, reading: ‘You were wonderful. Come see me again.’",
			"You think you broke, or very badly twisted, your ankle at some point, and your neck and shoulder isn’t doing so hot either.",
			"Your pinky finger on your dominant hand is definitely broken, and the skin of both of your hands are heavily cut and abraded. Several small shards of pottery need to be fished out of the wounds.",
			"Your skull is bleeding; as is typical of head-wounds, it bleeds profusely and makes the area you woke up in look like the scene of a murder. The wound will definitely require stitching.",
			"You realize, at some point in your revelry, you wound up the proud owner of a pumpkin farm somewhere in the countryside. Most of the gold you had on hand is gone, replaced with a crinkled roll of parchment recording the transfer of title.",
			"You wake up with 500 platinum and a warrant with your picture, but the name says, ‘Unknown thief 3 of 5’. Four other unknown thieves have their portraits hanging in the tavern.",
			"You wake up to the sound of a trumpet. All around you are dwarves in different states of nakedness and everyone has an instrument. Seems like you joined the Orchester.",
			"Someone yells at you to wake up, it seems you challenged a Guard to a duel at noon, you have 15 Minutes left, and you’re still drunk.",
			"You find yourself in a cage outside the city wall. You have no memory of how you got there or what for.",
			"As you wake up you discover a shiny new tattoo on your chest, it glows and it seems to be some kind of rune.",
			"You wake up and learn that you have adopted two things: A boy called Ismael and a Pig.",
			"You wake up in a tent full of sleeping, apparently drunk Goblins, there’s also a bounty on their heads. But all your weapons are gone.",
			"You wake up from the sound of the trees moving in the wind. With shock you realize you’re atop a giant old oak tree, the tallest in the forest.",
			"The sound of a Sergeants screams wakes you, looks like you volunteered in the army while you were drunk.",
			"You wake up in the safe of a bank- gold, silver and 2 sleeping dwarves surround you.",
			"You wake up in the local mages library having apparently drunkenly solved a complex magical mystery.",
			"You wake up in a jail cell from a kick in your ribs. The world is fuzzy, your head is pounding, and a large guard squats over you and whispers ‘So you like other people’s wives do ya?’",
			"You wake up half in a ditch of stinking greenish water. Something is crawling up your leg inside of your clothes then it bites your inner thigh…",
			"You wake up in a tavern bedroom in a cozy feather bed. All of your possessions are there and you seem to have gained 354 extra gold pieces and a note that says ‘Thanks, you were fabulous.’",
			"While out partying, you broke something expensive, but a local noble you were out with got caught with the blame and the bill. They plan to get payback one way or another.",
			"You committed a minor act of vandalism in a public place. Half the people you encounter are amused, the other half are offended.",
			"You impressed local bandits with your willingness to injure yourself to get laughs. They like you.",
			"You swore an oath to perform a great deed on behalf of a local church. In their temple. Standing on their altar. During a ceremony.",
			"You committed an act of public indecency while trying to retrieve a ferret from your trousers.",
			"You invested all your gold in a local loser’s get-rich-quick scheme. It’s actually not a bad plan, but he has his shirt on backwards and he’s perfectly sober.",
			"You traded clothes with a beggar. It was a generous impulse, but now you’re developing a rash and you forgot to retrieve an important personal item from a pocket.",
			"You wake up, and a half-full spittoon or chamber pot is attached to your hand by a powerful magical glue. A little searching in the filthy contents may or may not reveal a vial of solvent.",
			"You have three new tattoos, one of them is in a place that never sees sunlight. What are the new tattoos?",
			"You find a wedding ring (worth 1d10x1d100 gp) on your finger. An inventory of your coin-purse may or may not reveal that you paid for the ring somehow. The inscription is your name plus the name of someone you don’t know. Even after you take off the ring, you may or may not notice shadowy people following you.",
			"You wake up with a terrible headache, and are inside a closed casket turned upside down in an abandoned warehouse. A note that reads, ‘Be more careful next time’ may or may not be stuffed in your shirt pocket, and you may or may not know who signed it and put it there.",
			"The webs of your fingers and toes have been stitched together with either artful, elegant, and tiny stitches, or crudely glued together with magical glue. Has your mouth suffered the same fate?",
			"Your pants are on your arms and over your head, and your shirt is on your legs. Your socks and boots are laced up on your hands and a stuffed horse’s head is crudely attached by string onto your underwear (and backside). Something unspeakable and foul is inside the stuffed head.",
			"Your mouth tastes like the sole of your boot; then you realize your boot has been stuffed in your mouth while you sleep. A dog dropping wrapped in a lovely pink silken bow has been artfully deposited inside.",
			"A half eaten box of fancy chocolate in a heart shaped box falls off your chest onto the floor. A dead rat, clutching the remains of nougat may or may not reveal the chocolates are poisoned.",
			"You commissioned a painting of yourself, in a state of undress, astride a horse and leading a charge into battle. The finished painting, and a very expensive bill are somehow waiting for you outside. It may or may not be a very good likeness, or painted magically.",
			"You wake up and discover your skin is now blue, if you skin was previously blue it is bright orange.",
			"You wake up and can no longer speak common.",
			"You wake up with cuffs on that prevent you from casting more than a cantrip, a note says they will be removed after you apologize – no name.",
			"You wake up naked in the pews of the nearest temple.",
			"You wake up and discover you can’t lie without sneezing, wearing a disguise results in hiccups.",
			"You open your eyes to see the world has been inverted, your dexterity rolls are inverted until you next sleep.",
			"You awaken to find your self naked with a headless chicken in the middle of a demon summoning ritual. If you read the demons name aloud, he will be summoned and expect payment.",
			"You wake up sitting at the table of a regular house with a hot beverage in front of you and a sweet old lady asking how good was your night. The old lady will make small talk and offer food in case you want some.",
			"A dog pulling your clothes wakes you in the middle of a cornfield, at the end of a freshly made winding path, and leads you towards a barn house, where a farmer demands you pay from all the crops you stepped on.",
			"You come to your senses strapped to a pillory in the middle of a spanking/whipping session, ran by the town guards meant to discipline and punish you from all your drunken adventures. After a while, you’re fined 2d20gp and released if you pay, if not, you’re left in the pillory for 1d4 hours, or until someone else pays. Lose 1d6+1 hp.",
			"You wake up covered in blood, scrapes, cuts, and with a wobbly tooth. Your companions tell you that you stumbled in late last night yelling ‘You should have seen the other guy!’. Examination of your belongings reveals you are now 100GP richer. It seems you may have gotten into a fight with, or possibly mugged, somebody quite well off. There’s a heavy knock on the tavern door, and you can see guards outside.",
			"You awaken with an entire small tavern’s worth of people crammed into your bed in various states of undress. You’re sticky with spilled beer, somebody has drawn a huge moustache on your face in soot, and you have a horrible feeling that one of your new friends missed the chamber pot in the middle of the night. There is vomit in your left boot, and the right is missing entirely.",
			"You’re beaten awake by a twig broom. Looks like you made somebody else’s front room your bed for the night. The floor is piled with turnips, which you seem to have collected – your shirt is several feet away and stuffed full of the things. The house owner picks a turnip up, throws it at your head, and yells at you to get out.",
			"Several hundred rats surround your bed, staring unblinkingly at you. They will follow you, and obey simple commands, but only until sundown, when they disappear back into cracks and pipes and alleyways.",
			"You’re shackled to an oar in a galley.",
			"You awake with a letter in your hand, and the guilty memory that you swore on your life that you would deliver it. Unfortunately, you can’t remember who it was for.",
			"When you stagger downstairs into the tavern, a burly female half-orc grabs you and throws you down into a seat. Apparently you won an arm-wrestling contest against her last night, and she wants a rematch.",
			"You don’t remember any of your exploits last night, but the town bards apparently do. Worse, the song one of them wrote about you has become a comic hit and is being sung in every tavern in town within the week. Every time you hear the song, the details get wilder and wilder. You have no idea which of them are true.",
			"Somebody has shaved off all your hair. A quick check around your body reveals that, yes, they shaved all of your hair.",
			"When you go downstairs, all the residents of the tavern greet you with shouts and open arms. Seems that you jumped up on the bar last night and proclaimed ‘drinks are on me!’. You’re now quite a lot poorer.",
			"An angry innkeeper is demanding payment for an entire barrel of ale. Seems you got tired of your drinking horn, and decided to go straight to the source. That would explain why your clothes are completely soaked and stinking of stale beer.",
			"You bought a horse. She’s on her last legs, knock-kneed, toothless, swaybacked, and bad-tempered. She takes an instant dislike to you.",
			"You’re woken by jostling. When you open your eyes, you’re on a sedan chair being carried through a cheering crowd. Around your neck is a gold chain. In the distance you can see a stage with a table, and on the table is a feast. You’re now mayor of the town. It’s a pity that the town has a tradition of sacrificing its mayor after a year in office to placate the monsters that live beneath.",
			"You wake up face down on the street, just outside where you are staying. You don’t know how long you’ve been sleeping on your arms but both of them have gone to sleep entirely and you cannot manipulate either, only swing them limply."

		"name": "Cave Skill Challenges",
		"description": "Over 100 skill challenges that the party must face in the deep depths of a cave.",
		"author": "Internet Collaboration",
		"show": true,
		"rows": [
			"The party comes across a large lake of mud. There are large rocks jetting out of the mud, and the party must make an acrobatics check to get across. If they fall in, they will wake the creatures that live in the deep mud.",
			"The path the characters are taking runs into an underground river. The characters must cross the river to continue. They must make an acrobatics check to keep from slipping on the algae under the water.",
			"The party is bottle necked into a wide chamber. In the middle of the chamber is a gash of a ravine traversed by a wooden suspension bridge. Over the two posts on the bridge is the skull. If the players approach the bridge the skull will talk to the them trying to convince them of a contrived price to cross the bridge, trying to convince the biggest threat to it, or the whole group to cross at once. The bridge and the ravine is a mimic, when it reveals itself the gap in the floor peels up to form a wicked smile. This can be run as an encounter or as a skills challenge to notice it.",
			"There’s a fork in the caverns. A dwarf sits right next to the split. He says that he knows which way isn’t infested with cave dwelling monsters. The party must pull an investigation/intimidation roll to get him to tell them.",
			"A large brilliant sapphire sits on top of a stalagmite. No amount of strength will pro it off but the stalagmite can be broken with a strength DC of 18. However if an arcana check is used (or history if a dwarf or familiar with dwarf culture) a DC of 10 will remind the player that gems like this are semi living and to loosen it all you need to do is ask politely.",
			"A rope bridge spans over a bubbling lake. It can only hold approx. 300 lbs. at a time and requires a DC dexterity check of 12 to make over without incident.",
			"A huge mass of bats with razor sharp wings and fangs fly at the players. Plays can either dodge out the way dexterity DC of 10 if they fail any player with under 16 AC takes 2d4 damage from cuts and bruises and any player over 16 AC takes 1 d4.",
			"The party walk into the next room which has an all-consuming darkness light travels less than a foot and character with dark vision cannot even see. All plays with dark vision made a wisdom check or become frightened. (Fights against low-level enemies can become epic battles in rooms like this)",
			"The lady walks into a room that has a large network of glowing crystals in the ceiling. Any loud noise makes the crystals start falling from the ceiling. Player must make an athletics or acrobatics check to avoid them and not take any damage. DC of 11. Damage taken equals 11 minus roll d4. Players who roll a 1 or would take more than 6d4 damage take 6d4 damage and are trapped under the stone.",
			"Run into a lonely stone golem who is exuberant at having new friends. Party must make a deception check with DC 8 to convince her they will return soon otherwise she will try to fight them if they leave.",
			"Deep into the cave the party finds a room with polished rooms and an alter with a curved dagger on it. The alter is made of an impossibly black stone that is completely different from the rest of the cave. Along the alter channels are cut that lead to a hole in the ground. After the party enters a stone door slams behind them. Any player who picks up the dagger must make a DC wisdom throw of 13 or be compelled to try and sacrifice one of the other party members until they drop the dagger. Behind the alter is a switch that will open the door again but because of limited oxygen the party only has 2 minutes until they start suffocating.",
			"The cave is lined with sharp, jagged crystals that protrude from the walls. The PC’s must make a Dex check to see if they can maneuver through, otherwise they take slashing/piercing damage (small characters have advantage, large characters have disadvantage). The crystals can be smashed, but that makes noise, potentially alerting enemies in the area.",
			"Spaces too tight to walk through, so players must use acrobatics to squeeze through (heavy armor gives disadvantage, small characters have advantage). The gap could be widened by pulling aside stones, but that gives the chance of triggering a rockslide or cave-in. Narrow ledges that must be balanced along above a steep drop.",
			"The party enters a cave that is dimly lit but they can still see enough to know their surroundings. The problem with this cave is there is some sort of essence that makes all noises 4X louder, the noises from the party talking are enough to echo throughout the cave at a booming sound. This booming sound shakes the ceiling causing the large sharp rocks to fall from the ceiling down toward the party. If the character is hit, they take 1D6+3 damage plus a bleeding effect.",
			"DC 15 knowledge (nature) identifies bioluminescent worms in the wall, and the trigger for their glow, which is a gas that can occur naturally from vents or from somewhat decayed flesh.",
			"DC 10 Constitution check to resist cough from dust inhalation; failure grants a temporary -1 to strength.",
			"An entrance is made out of what appears to be a giant dragon head. To enter you’ll need to pry open its jaws with a strength check.",
			"A locked doorway with the figure of a good aligned deity carved into it is built into the wall. The players must present a holy symbol of the deity or must provide the proper prayer to open the door. A DC 15 religion check is required to know the prayer, with any characters who are followers of the deity having advantage. Clerics of the deity automatically succeed. Behind the door is a small, unoccupied sanctuary that allows your character to rest.",
			"A still, 30ft wide pit of non-Newtonian fluid blocks the way. Any character that has to dash across to make the distance (i.e. anyone with a speed less than 30) does not have to make a check. However, any character that attempts to walk across normally has to make a DC15 Dex check or be sucked down into the pit, triggering a series of Strength checks with increasingly difficult DCs (similar to quicksand).",
			"A cloister of flumphs block the way. They want to test how good and pure your heart is. Good-aligned players roll 1D20 with advantage to pass a charisma check. Neutral players have advantage as well. Evil players have disadvantage.",
			"An aggressive Owlbear blocks your way. Use animal handling to make it let you pass. Or fight it if you want…",
			"A toxic/flammable gas is seeping from the walls. If the players use any fire spells or even when fighting the sparks could ignite the flammable gas.",
			"Unstable stalactites fall from the ceiling of the cave and players have to make a Dex save to dodge the falling debris. The save and damage depends on size of stalactite and height it is falling from.",
			"The floor is literally lava. There are points to hop across (acrobatics) and an invisible rope lattice (investigation) one can hold on to. Anyone falling in gets burned!",
			"There is a fork with two statues. ‘One lies, one tells the truth’ is written above them. In fact, both statues always lie.",
			"A large dance hall has been carved out of the cave, with stone statues standing still in the middle. As soon as one of the adventurers steps onto the floor, music starts up throughout the hall, and the statues begin to whirl about the floor. The room is dangerously trapped, and the traps can only be avoided by dancing along to the music (Acrobatics or Performance check). A successful intelligence check to recognize the pattern allows the check to be made at advantage, and a bard may grant the rest of the party advantage by recognizing and calling out the beat with a performance check.",
			"A great chomping mouth holds a small magical chest. The chest can be removed without damage by a successful sleight of hand check, or the mouth can be made to laugh (persuasion) or shriek (intimidation) in order to keep it open. A failed check means a crushed hand.",
			"A great stone owl blocks the way. No party member can pass without imparting a piece of knowledge the owl has never heard- this can be any intelligence check besides investigation. Party members are not allowed to share, although anyone knowing thieves’ cant or a pair making a successful deception/perception roll can roll for each other.",
			"You find yourself in a great warren of tunnels. A successful Survival check (hard DC) allows you to find your way through. An insight or investigation check shows that the tunnels are patterned after blood vessels; a medicine check can then be made to have advantage on the survival check.",
			"A mass of fungi grows on all sides of the tunnel. Anyone brushing up against the fungi releases a cloud of spores; everyone within 5 feet must make a constitution save or take 2 levels of exhaustion. A party can step carefully through without disturbing the spores (acrobatics); alternatively, a Nature check reveals that the spores’ effect is neutralized by sufficient alcohol consumption.",
			"A group of otyughs are happily feeding in a pit of garbage. The party can sneak by (stealth), try to parlay with them (persuasion), attack them (combat) or pass along the thin side of the pit without descending in (acrobatics).",
			"The tunnel vertically splits suddenly, with the top portion a good eight feet above the sloping floor. A successful athletics check is required to jump and haul oneself up (assuming one can jump the requisite height). There are the remnants of a ladder on the side of the top tunnel.",
			"A strange blue gas comes out of a crack in the earth. If it catches a character, it leaves them extremely depressed- they are unable to use any charisma-based skills or spells and have disadvantage on other checks. A successful performance or persuasion check can cheer them up, as can any player who can think up a clever and witty enough pun.",
			"Someone has abandoned a half-orc baby in this cave. You must make an animal handling check (using charisma instead of wisdom) to keep the baby calm and happy. Afterwards, a successful persuasion check will get someone to take the baby in.",
			"Flames and smoke belch from cracks in the earth. A Nature check allows you to time the eruptions and avoid them; alternatively, acrobatics lets you leap out of the way just in time. Dwarves have advantage at either.",
			"A recent cave-in has lowered the ceiling of the tunnel, requiring an acrobatics check (small creatures have advantage).",
			"A very hungry, yet affectionate dog wearing an ornate collar approaches the party during their foray into the cave, either during a short or long rest, or at a point where there might be the smell of cooking meat (burned kobold works too) or other food. Animal handling check of DC 10, along with a morsel of food of any type will have the dog follow the party (a DC check of 15, if no food is available or given). The dog will follow the party and help them in the event of a crossroads/puzzle/maze, in which case the dog will help the party pick the path that leads away from danger (or toward the lesser of two evils). The dog will depart at the start of combat unless a party member succeeds at a DC 18 animal handling check. If a nat 1 is rolled during any of these checks, the dog will steal an item (maybe food related?) or attack a party member before running away. If a nat 20 is rolled, the dog will assist in all subsequent combats.",
			"An apparent dead end has a full- length mirror on one side. In the mirror, the party members see themselves laughing and mocking them. The mirror, if broken, reveals a stone wall behind it, but reforms in moments, with the mirror party still mocking derisively and making amusingly insulting gestures. A successful intimidation check causes the mocking reflections to flee, whereupon the mirror is revealed as a doorway to another room.",
			"A hall of statues sits before you, all of different historical figures from a bygone era. A history (or bardic knowledge w/ advantage) check reveals one of them was a thief famous for finding hidden passages in the palace and robbing the treasury. Moving his statue causes a rope to a secret treasure room to fall.",
			"A doorway in the side of the tunnel is strangely opaque. The doorway is ornately carved. An investigation check reveals that there is writing in (choose appropriate language for your cave): ‘Never Send a Clever Mind on a Fool’s Errand.’ Anyone who walks into the opaque doorway finds a large library atrium. It is richly furnished, with shelves of books extending high into the air. In the middle of the room is a large cage, surrounded by a moat. Inside the cage is some yummy stuff (choose gold, magic items, a McGuffin, something your party wants). The only way across the moat is a bridge, which has Very Obvious magical traps on it (think glowing, fiery runes and obvious wards). Any party member who either makes an Arcana check or speaks aloud about the traps (i.e. ‘what do those runes do?’) Is surprised by a book flying off of a shelf and settling on a table, which scoots over in front of them. The book is a compendium of information about runes and runecraft. Any question or desire for information of any kind is met with a similar reaction- an appropriate and highly useful book flies off the shelf and lands for perusal. Here is the kicker: the only way to get the stuff inside the cage is to walk straight through the runes and traps and open the (unlocked) cage door. Any other attempt is frustrated in a way that seems like you need a liiiiittle more information. To get OUT of the room, however, takes an insight save. The whole room is enchanted, and one cannot leave without making an appropriate insight check. Anyone with any skill proficiency in an intelligence-based skill makes the check at Disadvantage. If the party is able to somehow break the enchantment, they find the room is dark and ruined. All of the books are tattered and filled only with meaningless scribbles. There are a few dead adventurers (mainly wizards) in the room, still seated at tables, with stacks of books at their fingertips. There might even be a still-enchanted emaciated elf at one table, cobwebs growing around him as he searches for that last bit of knowledge. Everything learned from the books is illusory and is forgotten when you leave the room.",
			"DC 10 Nature Check reveals Ormu, a common yet bioluminescent moss. 15 or above reveals that following the patches of Ormu can lead to more rare and useful Fire Lichen. Follow the moss to a crack that small creature could fit through (or a DC 15 Athletics Check). The cave beyond is filled with Lichen but also has a lava swell passing through it. Every minute spent in the cavern requires a DC 15 CON save or take 1d8 fire damage.",
			"You come across a deep underground lake. In order to cross, you must steer a friendly but blind and hard-of-hearing giant tortoise that can ferry you across. To avoid yelling and attracting unwanted attention, a system based on touch is established. Failing an Animal Handling check will steer the tortoise in the wrong direction (toward rocks, other creatures, or even down into the water) or make him change his mind about helping you.",
			"A cave bear cub approaches you. You notice its mother sleeping not too far away. Any interaction you make with the cub requires an Animal Handling check to make sure you don’t upset it and wake its mother.",
			"The mushrooms growing in this tall wet cavern reach up to the ceiling on tiny, spindly stalks. The caps are wide, some spanning to 5 feet, and each one is populated by an ecosystem of bioluminescent bugs. The stalks reach up overhead 10 to 20 feet high, but the diameter of the stalk is merely a few inches. Damaging any of these mushroom stalks causes them to collapse under their own fragility. Dex save DC 15 when moving through to avoid toppling the ecosystem. One mushroom cap deals 1D2 damage, but toppling one likely topples the rest.",
			"The walls begin to bulge inwards and you start to notice large round stones littering the way forward. Continuing on is difficult terrain just due to the sheer number of round stones. After several minutes of struggling you come upon a clearing where several hammers and cracked stones are laid out on a blanket. Each round stone is a geode, able to be cracked with the hammer (Strength DC 12). They are beautiful, but cumbersome.",
			"Someone has carved out a lattice roof to cover this section of path. From it the moss ‘Old Man’s Beard’ grows, hanging down long white tendrils. Small round lanterns have been hung in between the mosses, but they are unlit. Nature check DC12 to determine the medicinal properties of this moss – allowing the party a free hit die of healing on a success",
			"A geyser erupts every few minutes along the path side in this cave. It strikes the low ceiling, just as it has been for hundreds of years. A sizeable hole has formed in the stone above where the water strikes, and now, when the water strikes the top, the hole forces the water to flow down in a scalding rain over the path. The party will need to dodge the scalding water with Athletics (run right through) Acrobatics (time it well) or some other appropriate skill or suffer 1D10 points of burning damage",
			"The natural tunnel is bisected by a subterranean ice flow. Some time ago, perhaps years, the ice was carved through by some adventurer to continue on to the rest of the tunnel, but the slow moving ice has pushed that tunnel down-flow. The entrance of the tunnel is no more than a foot and a half wide, and will need to be cut to accommodate anyone larger. The ice tunnel beyond is spacious, but the exit, once again, is tight. Small creatures pass right through. Medium Creature must succeed a Dex save DC 12 to squeeze past both the entrance and exit. Large creatures or creatures that failed their Dex save must pass a DC 15 Strength check to break the ice. Failure to do so makes the party spend 1 hour clearing out the ice.",
			"The tunnel is cut by a fissure in the stone, one-foot across, and spanning into the stone an unknown distance. The fissure is well lit by a magma flow running down one side of the fissure and along the bottom, but the magma is at least 10 yards away from the tunnel and poses no risk. The heat causes strong winds to blow through this fissure and through the tunnel. The jump across is easy. DC 5 Athletics or Acrobatics.",
			"A huge fungal colony pours poisonous gas into this chamber, and myconid spore servants rise to attack you if you dare enter. With enough wind and speed, you may clear the passage, but burning the fungus only fills the corridor with a too-thick cloud of poisonous smoke, blinding you. Careful not to trip on the skeletal arms grabbing your ankles, or you may join them.",
			"The party enters a room filled with statues. The statues move around when not being watched (stealth with advantage). If it is pointed out loudly to them, the statues shamefacedly return to their positions.",
			"A completely submerged passage of unknown length. Players can attempt to swim through it to the other side with a swim skill check, and a fortitude saving check if they do poorly on the swim check to see if they are at risk of drowning or panicking. Two or more adventurers who score above a 15 can retrieve a failing adventurer and assist them across and a health check allows them to revive them on the other side. The only danger is drowning but the length of the passage is far longer that most adventurers would feel comfortable traversing. An augury spell would not indicate that crossing the passage would spell disaster, excepting for some terrible rolls. Party members have to take a penalty for heavy armor. No hostile creatures inhabit the passage, but large fish could brush against the players in the dark and bioluminescent life can illume motes in the water also giving the adventures some indication of their surroundings and some exotic weird underwater life that appears largely uninterested in the party. If you are feeling kind, perception checks can allow the players to spot breaks above them where they might find pockets of air. Or maybe catch a glint of a trinket on the floor.",
			"The Sphere Pit – A large, open area filled with brightly colored spheres about the size of an elf’s fist. The spheres fill a pit approximately 30 feet in diameter. The spheres are tightly packed, such that anyone with the requisite speed (40) can run straight across the top without sinking in; anyone else can traverse the area with a successful swim check. Anyone in heavy armor sinks to the bottom of the pit and can walk along the bottom.",
			"The Immortal Court- Whoever is most wounded of the party (or whoever you as the DM feel would be most fun) suddenly dies (no save). As the rest of the party reacts, a portal opens and pulls them into a strange, richly furnished courtroom, filled with strange and shadowy beings. The dead party member is seated at one table near the front of the room, and as the rest of the party enters, they are allowed to pass through to seats near them. Seated next to the party member is an angelic version of them; at the opposite table, a fiendish version sits. Seated at the end of the room are three-cloaked figures- one in White, one in Black, and one in Gray. The gray one bangs a gavel and commands the prosecution to begin. The fiendish version stands and begins to recount the party’s crimes, with emphasis on the party member’s involvement in anything questionable or wrong. After this, the angelic version stands and gives a defense of the party. The fiendish version then begins calling witnesses- think a bandit the party killed, dead former party members, the members of a town they burned, or as appropriate. The angelic version then calls members of the party as witnesses in defense (have them make performance checks, with bonuses or penalties for the quality of their explanations). Before judgment is announced, however, an angelic messenger appears with a note, which is handed to the judges. They read it in silence, and then announce that the case is to be continued. There is a flash of light, and the party (including the ‘dead’ one) finds themselves back in their previous location. If the case was going well, i.e. the evidence seemed to point toward the more angelic side, the whole party (and especially the one on trial) get some buffs (they are, for example, under the effects of the bless spell). If, however, it was not going well, the one on trial feels a subconscious dread, affecting them like bane. These effects stay until the next long rest.",
			"A long hallway adorned with paintings of faces going down the hall, the further you go the more unnatural and disturbing the paintings become. Role to not enter a state of paranoia for the duration of walking trough the hallway.",
			"The party finds an old necromancer’s cave. It is set up like an underground tavern. There is a large stage and rows of seats filled by skeletons. The party must step on the stage and make a performance check if they want to get the necromancer’s treasure. If they fail the check the skeletons attack them, if they succeed a skeleton comes from the bar and gives them the necromancer’s treasure.",
			"A subterranean lake has filled a low point of the tunnel waist-deep. The water is slightly acidic, but otherwise harmless. Don’t tell your partners so, though. See what they do.",
			"The bottom of the tunnel has been illusively made to look like a bottomless pit. A narrow strip goes across the middle, covered in spikes. Walking on the narrow strip means 1 piercing damage every 10 feet and requires an acrobatics check. Anyone falling off is, of course, totally fine on the floor of the actual tunnel.",
			"Swarms of clot flies come buzzing up through the cavern. The clot flies fly directly at anyone who has taken damage that could result in wounding (not psychic or poison or radiant, probably, but slashing or piercing or fire, etc.). The clot flies seek out the wound to feast. Anyone so targeted must make a constitution save or be sickened for 10 minutes. Regardless of whether they save, a targeted character gains 2 hit points as a result of cleaning and disinfecting agents in the flies’ saliva.",
			"A roost of twenty blind cave basilisks are hibernating. Can you sneak by?",
			"A series of mirrors from an opening in the cave system shine a light down into the depths. The light gets amplified by the dozens of mirrors until it hits a focusing crystal array and launched downwards through a vertical mine shaft that has a steady stream of steam pouring up. Can you avoid getting burned by the beams?",
			"A ten foot closed fist of stone near a waterfall holds a key at the bottom to a great stone door. You either divert the waterfall or send a small party member down into the fist to retrieve the key.",
			"A Dire Toad hops out at the party. If there are any females (or male elves) in the party, it announces in common that one of them (roll randomly) is the one they have been waiting for to kiss them into their true form.",
			"A gigantic skeleton (possibly a fossilized whale) is embedded in the floor. Causing interesting time negotiating the passageway. Also can present skill challenge to identify the type of creature.",
			"In one of the tunnels in this cave your party will encounter a barrier of gelatinous matter, the color and consistency of bile. It stretches wall-to-wall, floor to ceiling, but doesn’t appear to be dripping, sloshing or behaving in a way befitting of ooze. If the party wishes, they can try to pass through it. It will part with relative ease and only takes up about 10 feet of this tunnel, but if they fail a DC 15 constitution/fortitude save, they gain a random disease. Alternatively, they can use a DC 15 nature check to determine the properties of the substance (i.e. the disease it carries), a DC 15 arcana check to see what might be effective against it (cold damage, or whatever fits your campaign), a DC 15 medicine check to take a sample and examine it (find the disease), or a DC 15 athletics check to see if they can run through it without getting infected (minimum 20 ft. speed).",
			"An army of goblins has chased the players towards the edge of a pit, where a giant stalactite hangs, which looks loose. The players could try and somehow trick the goblins to fall in, but another option is make an athletics or acrobatics check to jump onto the stalactite, which will begin to fall when all the players grab on. They must make an athletics check to hang on while it is falling. The DM can determine how deep the pit is and scale it to the players HP.",
			"Golems made of diamond are slowly beginning to form. The players have to find ways to prevent them from growing and starting a high CR encounter.",
			"One section of the cave has acidic slimes dripping from the ceiling. Successful travel through the section requires either a succeeded perception skill check of 15 or higher, or a dex save skill check of 10 or higher. Failure of both instances results in the player taking 3d6 acid damage.",
			"If the party is traveling though the cavern at nighttime, they encounter a section where far above, the ceiling opens to the sky. There are stars aligned in such a way that it creates a glowing ray of light into the room. A successful Arcana roll of 15 or higher informs the party that any spells of 1st level or higher cast inside the ray of light will heal the player for 1d4 healing. This effect ends permanently after the first sunrise.",
			"The party encounters a natural magical rock and gem formation that damages the players with lightning if they walk past it. A successful Arcana check of 10 or higher informs the player that any spellcaster walking past the rocks will complete a magical circuit and cause the electricity. The gems can be mined from the rocks for 50 gp worth of uncut gemstones.",
			"A cave-in occurs, blocking the entrance/a point behind them. If under, it takes a DC 12 Athletics or acrobatics to avoid the falling rocks or take 3d6 damage. The party can either press on or make a DC 20 athletics to remove rocks over a 3-hour period.",
			"The party finds a burbling spring flowing into a pool that appears to be just shallow enough to wade across. There is a skeleton in the pool with something glinting on its still clenched hand. The pool its self is actually a clever semi transparent magnifying illusion over a deep pit approximately 150ft deep with the skeleton at the bottom. Attempts to reach in and grab the skeleton give the impression that they are not reaching deep enough tricking people into falling in. An intelligence check (DC 17) is made to realist that the spring cannot exist there geologically. If they pass the illusion fails for them and they can see the pit and its contents. The glinting object is a Ring of Water Walking.",
			"Players come across a very large birdcage hanging from the ceiling, in it is a skeleton of a Roc. DM needs to roll a secret Perception check. Success they smell gas, failure they start taking 4hp of damage from poison gas but don’t feel it until 50% of health is gone.",
			"A particularly fast-growing strain of razor-sharp ‘golden’ needles and ‘thread’ react to the presence of living, organic matter within 30 feet. Able to ‘lunge’ or ‘fly’ 2d6 feet per round, the needles seek out soft, fleshy bits and pierce them, dealing a fair amount of damage on contact. The metal needles are poisonous to life, but actually drain magical energy from creatures in this way, converting positive energy to matter, as a way to reproduce and spread. With proper study, magical and alchemical prowess, and a fair bit of danger, the needles can be collected and refined into actual gold. Consider treating the needles as Striges.",
			"A sweet, soft smell fills a corner of the cavern, centered on a large underground swampy area. Anyone coming within 40 feet of the area must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to walk closer to the area and into the range of a giant pitcher plant, which attempts to swallow anyone of medium size or smaller. Anyone swallowed by the plant takes 2d6 acid damage each round. A character can escape with a DC 12 Athletics check.",
			"A pack of rust monsters have taken this part of the cave as their home, and will attempt to devour any metal or coins that get near them. When defeated and examined, the rust monsters have developed bands of precious metals in the carapaces, allowing adventurers to try to scavenge some. A successful nature check allows for more precise extraction of metals, otherwise adventurers have to drag 100+ pounds of scrap metal if they want to spend time refining it.",
			"A pit of lava with stepping-stones. Players succeed a DC 10 Dex check to cross, or take 3d4 burning damage. A DC 7 Perception check reveals a much easier path that is infested with spiders, requiring a DC 5 Fortitude/Con save (whichever is preferred) to pass through unharmed. If failed, the victim takes exactly 1 poison damage.",
			"An old door covers the entrance to the next room. It has no visible hinges; it has a handle, but has ‘Push’ hewn on it in Terran (‘KROKTH’ or your own word). It is unlocked, but stuck, taking a DC 14 strength check to unstick if pushing. If pulling, one must pull the entire door out of its hinges, requiring a DC 30 strength check.",
			"A heavily stylized image of a god with an altar in front of it, recognizable with a DC 16 Religion check. Leaving an offering appropriate to the god depicted results in a blessing/reward of the god’s choosing.",
			"A long passageway with bioluminescent mushrooms growing on the walls. These mushrooms visibly release spores and smell terrible. A DC 15 nature check must be passed in order to determine what kind of mushroom they are. If the check is passed it will be revealed that the mushrooms are a rare kind and very sought after because the stems can be used as a ingredient for many types of potions and can fetch for a decent sum of gold in large amounts (the amount people will pay for them is up to DM’s discretion). Unfortunately the mushrooms release large amounts of flammable and poisonous spores. If the party has any lit torches or anything similar the spores will catch fire and the party will take 1d10 or 2d8(DM’s discretion) fire damage. If they don’t then they must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or they will fall asleep and might get attacked by the monsters that make these caves their homes, holding their breath and/or sprinting through the passage will either nullify this throw or give the party advantage on it (once again up to DM’s discretion).",
			"This cavern has a hole in the floor and the roof, both about 5 feet across. As the party enters the room they see a chest fall from the roof through the floor. Looking into the pit just reveals inky blackness that no light or darkvision can penetrate. After about 30 seconds, the chest falls from the roof again. Anyone in the way will be struck and must succeed a dexterity check or be knocked into the hole, where they will continue to endlessly fall along with the chest until either are retrieved or they make much harder dexterity check to catch the floor as they fall past.",
			"The party enters a huge room. The walls are decorated with elaborate paintings of animals, and three 5 feet squares on the floor have animal paintings too – an owl (int), a bear (str), and a hawk (dex). Above the door in the other side of the room (about 100 feet from the squares) a sentence is written in celestial (or any language you’d like): ‘Your strengths will be tested. Your restrain will be tested.’ if an entity with over 16 in the corresponding stat step into the square, they are incapacitated, blinded and silenced. If all 3 squares are activated, the door to the next room will open. If they break any of the square’s magic (DC 17 dispel magic roll, -1 for each extra level of dispel magic) the door opens, but the room is flooded from that door, and they need to swim their way against the current to get to the next room.",
			"The party realizes that they have been setting up camp every night in the same spot they camped the night before. No matter how far, how fast, or in which direction they travel, they always find themselves setting up in the same spot. A successful Investigation check reveals that cunning stonework walls are being shifted throughout the cave system, leading them away from their goal and back to their campsite (dwarves/gnomes/other industrious races have Advantage on this check). A successful Wisdom check reveals that they have entered the outskirts of an Illithid community. Psychic suggestions have been put in place to keep potential thralls in a loop until they can be captured.",
			"The party encounters a [insert appropriate Challenge Rating monster] that is acting oddly until it notices them. It turns to face them and swings between attacking the party and asking for help. A successful skill check (Intimidation/Persuasion to make the monster back down, Investigation to notice an odd detail, Arcana to feel the residual magic energies, etc.) reveals that this monster is a mostly-Polymorphed being originally of a ‘good’ race. A wizard’s experiment turned it into an unwilling monster. Unwillingness to investigate further leads to a challenging combat encounter.",
			"The characters come to a dead end with a ghost. The ghost has the ability to open the dead end up to the rest over the cave, but says he isn’t in a good mood. The characters must make a DC 13 CHA (persuasion) check to get him to open it up. They are given advantage if they offer to leave behind something interesting, though he is only interested in material/beautiful things that he can look at like paintings, gold, or flowers.",
			"The party encounters a pool of lava preventing them from progressing further. Across the pool is a metal drawbridge in the upraised position. A successful perception/investigation check reveals a small button across the pond next to the drawbridge. Successful lowering of the drawbridge requires the button to be pressed, either by rock throw/arrow shot or a really long stick (or some other creative solution).",
			"Some strange phenomenon of water and crystalline mystery has turned a section of the cave into a house of mirrors. A successful perception or investigation check is required to navigate the way past the reflections and to the other side of the cave (or you could obscure the mirrors with some sort of paint). If you go through a wrong ‘passageway’, well, the walls have sharp parts and you’re walking straight into them.",
			"A member of the party puts a hand on the warm walls of the cave and feels rumbling, as burning hot water shoots out from all sides up ahead. The party must get through these jets of water and steam. The party must each make a dex check, or be scalded by the burning water.",
			"A hallway with buttons or levers on each wall in 10 feet increments. Between each set of buttons/levers there are arrow traps that will trigger if not properly deactivated. Players can deactivate each trap by pushing the buttons/pulling the levers at the same time (choose a roll and the players have to get within 5 of each other on their rolls).",
			"Root Room: The Party comes across a cavern filled with thick roots. Somewhere far above a massive tree must be growing. These roots twist and turn as if alive as they grow deep into the mountain, making short work of the rock as they power through in their search for water. These roots require a DC15 strength check to get through, DC12 with a bladed weapon. A DC 15 dexterity check can also be done to climb through the moving roots as they writhe.",
			"A red gas seeps out of a vent or from the spores of a strange mushroom, somewhere nearby and fills the tunnel with fog. Disadvantage on Perception and all characters must pass a DC13 Will save or immediately go into a berserk rage and make a melee attack, with the intent to kill, at the nearest creature, expending a use of Barbarian Rage if they have it. The rage continues until someone can make a DC15 Diplomacy or Intimidate check to control the berserker. Once saved, the creature is immune from the rage effects of the gas until their next long rest. Optional: The gas is also flammable and sufficient concentrations (50% chance of a 10 foot square area going off when exposed to flame, shock, or high heat) of the stuff deals 1d10 fire damage and 1d10 force damage to creatures in the square.",
			"A luminous green gas seeps from faintly glowing pools, and seems attracted to wealth or objects or creatures of beauty as if someone had cast Faerie Fire on them. It appears to move on its own and travel up to 100 feet unless a breeze disperses it. Optional: The gas forces all who share its space to pass a DC 13 Will save or begin coveting that which the gas is most attracted to, seeking to acquire it. Once infected by the gas, the victim may make a DC13 Will save each day, with the difficulty increasing by 1 per day they have not gained the item, their madness driving them to greater lengths to get the item and prevent others from having it. Another character attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check must pass a DC that is +2 higher than the current dc of the save in order to snap the creature out of it. Once saved, the creature is immune from the effect for 24 hours.",
			"The Dendritic Constriction – The roots of what appears to be an enormous tree have filled the cavern with their tangled and fibrous obstructions. It’s passable, but only barely and unobstructed area is visible on the other side. To pass through, the characters must succeed in a series of Dex/Acrobatics or Climb checks or become entangled. Once entangled, they must succeed on a Dex save or remain stuck. If any harm is done to the roots by either a Strength check attempt or direct attack, the roots reflexively begin to constrict all characters within its area of influence, doing damage each round that the characters don’t make another Dex save or otherwise appease or defeat the tree.",
			"Sea Cave – The PCs have to make it through the cave before high tide when the cave fills up with water.",
			"Underwater Passageway – One of the passageways is completely filled with water. PCs have to make a (athletics, swimming) check to make it from one end of the passageway to other while holding their breath. May also require a (navigation, Int) check to not become disoriented in the dark murky waters.",
			"The Moths – The room appears to be covered in scales. Upon closer inspection the scales are some kind of subterranean moth. If disturbed the moths take flight in swarms. If there is an open flame when the moths take flight, they will ignite filling the entire chamber with fire for 3 rounds. If there is no source of flame the moths will block all vision for 10 rounds. PCs must make a (acrobatics, dex) check to avoid triggering the swarm.",
			"The chamber ahead slops down to an underground river with a strong current. There are several other exits in the room. If anyone tries to cross the room, the discover the floor is very slick. Anyone attempting to cross the room needs to make an (acrobatics, dex) check or the start to slide towards the river. Anyone who falls in the river is sucked away by the current.",
			"The Bowl – The chamber slops down to the center of the room like a bowl. The floor & walls are also slick. Anyone entering the room will slide to the center of the room. PCs must find some way to scale the sides of the bowl to escape the room. -20% to thief climb walls skill due to slippery surface.",
			"Old Mining Tunnel – The tunnel has partially collapsed. The mines support beams are the only thing holding up the ceiling. Unfortunately the beams are also blocking the path. (Dex check) to squeeze past, bonus for small size, increase difficulty if wearing armor. (Int check) to strategically remove beams & debris to make a path, on a failed roll the tunnel collapses",
			"The Vertical Shaft – A 6ft wide tunnel goes straight up for about 60ft. A thief might be able to climb it. 3 (athletics, dex) checks for 2 PCs to climb it back to back. (Con check) at 30ft or rolls are made at -1.",
			"The party is confronted by strange motes of light filling the cavern. Getting to the opposite side without touching one seems improbable. Touching one reveals that each mote deals 3d6 radiant damage (raised or lowered based on level), searing the skin before disappearing. How will the party cross? (Casting Darkness causes the lights to fade in that area while the spell is active, but don’t outright tell them that unless they cast it).",
			"The party is sneaking along when the front guard’s boot crunches down on something. Looking, they see that they have just stepped on a buried humanoid skull. Looking forward, the party now sees that what they previously took for oddly shaped rocks or stalagmites are in fact bones and piles of bones. If they proceed, have some portion of the bones animate into skeletons. The point being that they don’t know which ones are undead and which ones aren’t. The best thing to do is stealth, but they might not realize that.",
			"A narrow and foggy passage leads onwards for some time, seemingly repeating. Only a successful investigation check can reveal a false wall along the path to escape. A party member might also coincidentally break through the wall. A sufficient spell might also be able to break the cave’s enchantment.",
			"You find an old abandoned experimental mining complex that appears to be a collaboration between a dwarven mining guild and a gnomish tinkerer guild. Automated mine carts still blast along the tracks at random intervals. Make perception checks to see if you can see if the carts are coming, then make dexterity checks to avoid getting hit. Some appear to still contain some riches, but good luck stopping the carts without risking life and limb.",
			"The Dark: A cavern filled with beautiful glowing crystals. The crystals absorb, amplify, and then emit light. Any light source rapidly becomes unbearably bright. Each turn, for each creature crossing the area, roll a 1d6. On a 4 or better, the creature traversing the area must resist an attack similar to the spell Sunbeam, and may save for half damage. Using the spell Shatter will expose all creatures within 50 feet of the area to the Sunbeam spell but only deal half damage. If magical darkness or a spell that blocks line of sight is used, for each creature instead roll 1d6 and on a 6 the Sunbeam attack pierces thru but deals half damage.",
			"The Razor Maw: A cavern of milky white crystals with a narrow and winding path that will take several rounds to traverse. The crystals resemble the teeth of a giant creature and seem to malevolently (if slowly) grind open and closed with a terrifying silence, slicing anything, with a hardness less than steel, with an atomic precision; dealing crushing damage and slashing damage. They grow back quickly if smashed (1d6 turns), and using a spell like Shatter only gives a respite for a moment."

			"A friendly looking man in light brown robes approaches the party. He is surrounded by 7 golden birds. He offers to read the fortune of the party in exchange for enough coin to buy a meal and bed for the night (I usually use 5 GP). If they acquiesce, he asks them to ask a question and he answers using the Divination spell. A successful perception check (DC 15, ARC skill of +5 or higher automatically succeeds) will reveal that he hasn’t actually cast any spell, but his answers are always truthful. Once he is out of sight of the party, he disappears.",
			"A homeless man/woman approaches begging for food and or shelter for the evening. Party agrees, they’ll wake up and a large sum of money sits by them but he or she is gone. If they refuse, then days later they hear in the news a man shown kindness in a person’s time of need. Billionaire gives man money.",
			"A raving madwoman stops everyone she sees, telling the story of how she was the mistress of the Mayor or King. Her mind is broken, and her speech is rambling, but the stories she tells are very consistent and convincing.",
			"A voice calls out from a darkened alleyway, it sounds in distress, but is quickly muffled.",
			"The cobble pavement collapses in a major street revealing a dungeon (or unknown sewer beneath. In a short period of time a large portion of the city guard will come to inspect and clear crowds. A single old crippled man will climb from within the hole and collapse once he reaches the light.",
			"A parade blocks traffic while many people stop what they are doing to watch.",
			"A circus strongman flexes and struts in a chalk ring. A halfling barker stands on a soap box, challenging anyone walking by to test their mettle against the steel thews of Kourteous the Mighty, Terror of the Ring! Best out of three clinches wins.",
			"A very large wild animal calmly walks down the street. People run away and shout, but the beast seems uninterested in them.",
			"A merchant offers the exact same items the party already owns, but if they buy anything, they will find the exact object missing from there bag. If confronted about it, the merchant will flee leaving the party with all the items, but their bags are empty (they have one of each item again). The players can buy and keep two of any item by taking it out of there backpack and holding it while buying the duplicate.",
			"Several acrobats occupy a part of the street and display great skill and dexterity in their movements and contortions.",
			"A tower full of boiling molasses/oil/etc. groans and collapses from atop the roof of a local apothecary/wizard. Any caught in the rushing wave of scorching liquid stand to have the flesh melted from their very bones!",
			"The doors to a brewery explode open and thousands of gallons of beer rush out and swamp the streets. Many townsfolk quickly gather buckets, pitchers, and other containers and start scooping up what they can.",
			"Two gentlemen or women surrounded by guards seem to be getting into a bit of a fight. They’re yelling loudly and making convincing swings at each other. They position themselves, and as one swings with all his/her might, the other ducks, and they manage to knock over one of the guards, dashing out of the circle as quickly as possible. As they pass your party, one of them tosses you a mysterious object as they pass. Along with the object is a hastily scribbled note that reads, ‘MIDNIGHT, , MEET’.",
			"Two merchants stand nose to nose screaming at each other, their carts are intertwined, and they are blocking traffic. Their horses seem to be nonplussed and nibble at nearby grass.",
			"You find a potion seller that had all the labels to his potions torn of in the middle of the night by a trickster rouge that has been terrorizing the city in recent weeks. To make matters worse, due to the ‘discrete’ nature his clientele, all of the potions have been bewitched so they are immune to the use of an Identify spell. He is desperately trying to sell the rest of his unusable stock at a discount to anybody passing by. Each potion is 20gp or comes in bulk packs of 12 for 200gp.",
			"A man runs by, screaming, seemingly battling a large octopus that has latched itself to his head and is spraying ink everywhere. No one recognizes the man, and fewer know where one could find a large octopus.",
			"You bump into a figure in a sharp traveler’s cloak. The figure either places a magic item in your pocket that is being hunted by the town guards or the figure steals a magic item from you and runs. Upon finding the figure either way you come to learn they are a royalty among the criminal underworld and want to hire you for their next big score.",
			"A skilled bard is performing in a local noble’s garden. The sounds can be heard clearly outside and a small crowd of passersby has stopped to appreciate. The Noble’s guards are debating if they can/should disperse the crowd.",
			"The party hears an alarm bell ringing loudly a few blocks out of sight, which is quickly picked up other alarm bells around the city. Large flagpoles around the party’s section of the city of quickly raise up orange flags, and a general call of ‘code orange’ is taken up by everyone nearby as citizens rapidly pack up stalls and evacuate the streets with practiced ease. The ground begins to tremble by the time all nearby citizens are tucked into alleys or taking shelter indoors, and within seconds of the street clearing, a stampede of brightly colored oxen around a corner and barrel down the party’s street. If the party has taken shelter, they are trapped where they are for the next 30 seconds as the small flood of animals passes by them, after which the locals quickly go about setting up shop as if nothing had happened. If the party is in the path of the oxen, they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and are dragged 40 feet in the direction of the stampede for each turn that they remain in it, with the stampede counting as difficult terrain in any area it occupies. If the party manage to get someone to explain the situation, it is revealed a powerful but unstable sorcerer named Wizbo often conducts strange ‘experiments’ in his ‘wizard tower’, and that the particular section of the city he belongs to has adapted and developed a warning system to alert the locals to incoming magical shenanigans. In this case, a code orange indicates actual potential danger and advises citizens to clear the streets and take shelter indoors until the alarm has passed.",
			"A local baker has created a new type of baked good and is giving samples to everyone. From the sounds of appreciation, it is quite good and there is already a line to both try the food and to enter the store.",
			"Some of the citizens are exchanging messages in thieves cant. Messages like “it begins in 30 minutes” and “get in position”. 50% chance it’s a daring heist and 50% chance it’s a flash mob.",
			"A horse, saddled and with a large pack slowly ambles down the street, the stays and ties having clearly been broken. Surely the owner will want it back.",
			"The Laughing Prince, a controversial thief, has been captured. Half of the populace think he’s a hero of the people; the other half think he’s a ruthless cutthroat. His public execution is scheduled for midday in the town square, and the crowd on both sides is getting increasingly reckless and ugly…",
			"Several guardsmen can be seen checking strangers to see if they paid their gate tax or if they are residents. Most people seem to have a piece of paper indicating one or the other.",
			"A fire has broken out in the Market District and is growing fast. The party can work to put out the fire, can try to alleviate the panic, or perhaps try to pick up some abandoned items for a *substantial* discount…",
			"A well-dressed man accompanied by two rough looking guards is politely inquiring if anyone has paid the Thieves’ Guild Tax and if they need to renew their licenses. As soon as he spots the party, he smiles widely and approaches.",
			"It’s the Regent’s/Mayor’s birthday and the streets are awash with celebrations. An amiable man wearing the city colors and crest persuades (DC15 CHAR) the party to go on a discounted city tour (subsidized by the city council) of some of its less famous sites with his colleague sat in the box-seat of an elegant carriage. It is in fact a dodgy scheme to eek money out of travelers. The coachman venerates the cities beautiful attractions, recklessly hurtling the rig through the foot traffic. He deposits you at the first stop. A temple. Here a weaselly monk attempts to persuade (DC10 CHAR) the party to generously donate to the temple and depart with earthly possessions. The coachman will be very encouraging and optimistic about the next stop being enticing and is according to the coachman a renowned tailor. In the dingy shop a short scowling man will stalk the players as they browse the store, seizing any opportunity to try and convince them to buy his garments. At this point the players will have little sense of where they are without some means of navigation. The coachman is adamant that the last stop will make it all worth it. The final stop from the outside appears to be a theatre with elaborate decorations and promotions. An attractive host receives them at the doors, and leads them down a dimly lit hall, through another set of doors and into an empty auditorium. She tells them to take a seat at the front by the stage before retreating to the double doors and locking them. (2d8+3) thugs rise from the concessions stands with loaded crossbows aimed at the players heads, and the amiable man strides out on to the stage. He demands the party’s valuables in exchange for their lives.",
			"One of the PCs trips over something in the street. Reaching down they find a coin purse, heavy and clinking. Just then an angry voice bellows, ‘My money! I’ve been robbed!’ The crowd steps back and a well-dressed noble point to the party and screams, ‘Thieves!’",
			"A frail looking stray cat follows you no matter where you go in town, the cat seemingly following you with intent.",
			"A cloaked figure asks where the local library is. You can hear the muffled sounds of chewing paper while he talks. And in his wake, he leaves shreds of pages.",
			"A loud, colorful troupe of dwarves enter the city square; they pitch a tent and within a few hours, they announce that the traveling unarmed fight championship will be held – all who deem themselves worthy can try and earn a goblet full of gems and honor, for a small fee. Inside, a large, wooden octagonal platform sits on the center stage… but there is a trick: it stands a few feet above the ground, balancing and tilting on a stout pole on its center, and a ring-out is an immediate disqualification. The tricky dwarven fighters have specialized on pushing off opponents as soon as they enter, and those who are hardier and can hold their ground and reach the finals find that the surface starts to spin, using centrifugal force to slide them off (the champion, of course, doesn’t even try to fight and just holds to the post)",
			"A group of city guards are clustered around the entrance to an alleyway. They look concerned and serious. One guard exits the alleyway, and abruptly bends over and vomits with gusto all over the pavement. If any approach, they are waved away — ‘Nothing to see here. Go about your business.’",
			"A sign outside a shop selling manuscripts is crooked and jutting out into your path. If straightened or moved, a shelf of books falls over, knocking over another shelf of small paintings. Four servant boys appear in fresh finery. In the distance, the wail of a siren.",
			"In a nearby back alley, an observant party member spots a lone cur, that whimpers and withdraws deeper into shadow. With skill checks, a player approaches to find: A hungry stray grateful for a bite, that reveals a secret tunnel it uses to navigate the city. Or the hungry ‘cur’ is companion to a Ranger, judging by the collar he wears. Another Ranger can communicate with him, following him to an injured/dead/captured fellow ranger. The ‘cur’ is a formidable hound badly treated by his owner. It might be a wealthy arrogant merchant, an animal handler in a traveling circus, etc. The hound can become a follower/familiar/companion.",
			"A nearby building explodes, and trees rapidly grow from the rubble. Bystanders explain that this is the third attack like this in a month, and that they are the work of an anarchist collective of druids that believe cities are blasphemy upon nature.",
			"Near the wizard’s college is a stand selling ice cream. Occasionally, the bound elemental keeping it cool will try to break free, causing the cart to shake. The bored teenage girl running the stand takes no notice of this.",
			"A miniature stage is set up on the side of a street, within it, small illusions tell the story of great adventures slaying a beast like a magical puppet show. A crowd of children sit on the floor in front of this and adults stand a little further behind. When it ends, all the kids run off to wherever they’re going, and a member of the party feels their purse get a little lighter in the commotion.",
			"A child runs up to you and tries to sneakily stab you. Her eyes pierce through her long black hair that covers her face. This little girl stares at you. You can feel an evil and malicious presence.",
			"A doll or easel falls from a nearby multi-story building and nearly lands on the head of someone in the party! Anyone who looks at it feels a faint sense of unease, but it also looks expensive and valuable. You can hear an argument from the loft whose window it seemed to have dropped out of, and soon enough someone will lean out of it and ask the party if they can bring it upstairs, since they aren’t finished with their artwork. If pressed, the artist says that he has other matters to attend to and can’t come downstairs, but it’s urgent that he get that piece back and soon. Is he just rude and bad at interacting with other people? Is he afraid of the outside? Is he in danger, or is he luring the party into some kind of trap? Will he even reward the party for giving him his work back? It’s up to the DM.",
			"1d4+1 Students of the nearby wizarding academy try out their newly learned spells in the alleyway and accidentally a firebolt hits the party members.",
			"A man with a strange accent whose clothes incorporates the bones of animals is convincing nearby townsfolk to join him on a hunt on the morrow. Given the way that people are talking about him, he seems to be very convincing and jovial. He’s just finished talking to a couple down the street, and he’s eyed your party. He seems to be headed your way!",
			"2d6 of friendly drunken hobbits ask the party to join their celebration of their newborn family member. They offer good ale and raspberry flavored tobacco",
			"A bald man in robes is busy eating from a plate while also kickboxing a couple of brawny-looking folks in the regalia of the city guard. He seems to be making a fool of them. Given the crowd of onlookers, you’re not sure if this is some kind of performance or just a hilariously failed attempt by the guard to arrest this man.",
			"3d6 of spectral butterflies briefly circle around a party member with the highest wisdom and then fly away. People say it brings good luck, but no one knows.",
			"A famous, beloved explorer will be delivering new relics to the local museum or gallery and wants to unveil them all in a brand-new wing of the building in a few days. One of the menial guilds has backed out on contract, though, so she’s short on manpower to actually set everything up and guard the exhibition until opening day. If you’re interested, she’s hiring- and she’ll pay handsomely. Suspiciously handsomely, for menial work.",
			"Random friendly dog happily brings a leather pouch containing 1d6 silver pieces and 1d4 human fingers.",
			"You come across several guardsmen hoisting a large battering ram so they can heave it against a gate. It seems the city official whose mansion is behind that gate is unwilling to leave- not only are the gates barred, but the window drapes are drawn down, and the doors are bolted shut. They were supposed to show up for an important meeting yesterday, and were going to make a speech today, but no one’s heard anything from anyone inside. Most of the locals are worried- though some seem to be happy about it.",
			"The players hear humming coming from underneath a manhole cover. If they open said manhole cover, they find a male gnome with a monocle and a top hat. He explains that he was trapped down there in a storm and that the manhole cover is a portal to a different realm. If the players walk into it, they end up in limbo.",
			"A man in beggars robes appears. 7 tiny canaries with him. He asks the players to spare some food or coin. He is actually Bahamut in human form. If they help him, he grants them his blessing. They have advantage on WIS rolls for the next hour. If they don’t, he moves along. If they attack the canaries become Wyvern. After players are subdued Bahamut gives them a lecture on justice and charity.",
			"A city-guard is busy giving a lecture to a newbie. They use the players as an example, either positively or negatively, depending on their status in the city’s eyes. For example: ‘Stop and Frisk’ if the party are scofflaws, or ‘Soliciting Bribe’ if the setting is somewhat fascist or corrupt. If the city views the players positively, the interaction is along the lines of ‘Did you see that ludicrous display last night? (Sports)’ or ‘Good day, Squire’ or something germaine to the overall plot. (‘You be safe out there; I hear the masked bandit has struck again!’) It could also be used as a way for the guards to deliver a message/invitation to the players: ‘Stop by the Station, the Lieutenant would like a word with ye’. In an espionage campaign, the Player-Guard interaction may be used to communicate with the team secretly; falsely arresting and then slipping a message or dragging in to talk in a theatrical manner. It could also be used as an intimidation tactic by a well-connected political figure who controls the guards and has made enemies of the players… (‘This is a message! *smash!*’)",
			"A gaggle of urchins hurries through the crowd city streets towards the party. One of them makes eye contact, before hurrying past and heading around a corner. The city guard pushes their way forward asking everyone if they saw which way the kids went.",
			"The noonday bells only chimes twice before the rope holding the bell snaps and it plummets down the steeple, landing with a resounding gong, blowing the temples door open, and making many townsfolk believe there is devilry afoot.",
			"While walking by the stocks, one of the prisoners recognizes someone from the party, and asks a favor. Could be something as simple as scratching an itch they can’t reach themselves, or perhaps something more involved.",
			"An intelligent huge mimic on a sturdy roof top of a one-story building with other several buildings snug down on both sides. The mimic mainly stays on the edge of the roof draping a part of itself down the side of the tight alley side outside wall. It forms itself as a wet metal ladder. As an added incentive the mimic drops coins from pervious victims a few at a time to bait its ladder. When someone grasp hold of the ladder (both hands and a foot hold), the mimic exudes its adhesive and grapples by rolling up its ladder/self at the same time. The mimic eats atop the roof.",
			"A woman is being attacked by thugs. If you ignore her cries for help, she gets taken away. If you help her, she takes you to her home where she and her sisters reveal themselves as succubi and try to kill you.",
			"You see a drunkard stumbling about. He greets your PCs in a friendly if overly affectionate manner before shuffling off singing at the top of his lungs.",
			"There is a striped carriage with the number 53 on the side that is someone moving uncontrollably without any houses (or driver for more modern RPG).",
			"A War-priest with a flaming sword steps in your way. He’s limping and looks beaten up but holds himself proudly. ‘So here it ends.’ he speaks as a bewildered look slowly enters his face. ‘You’re not them. I’m very sorry, please go along.’",
			"A small critter (of the DM’s choice) appears to be causing chaos, as everywhere it scampers people flee in horror.",
			"You stumble upon an alleyway chat and discover one stall in a nearby busy market is rigged to detonate in a Fireball when a specific noble approaches.",
			"You step in some viscous green goo… and it slithers away from you into a nearby sewer grate. The ground rumbles.",
			"The street is literally alive. This part of the city was built over a large Earth Elemental, but it doesn’t seem bothered to carry people to their destinations. However, it decides to block the adventurers from entering the street.",
			"A bird plummets from the sky right on a party member’s head (1d4 physical). There is an arrow right through it… and a missive attached to its back. Someone didn’t want this getting to its destination.",
			"A street magician decides to turn your party’s most anger-prone member into a joke. He uses prestidigitation to cover them in slick oil, change the color of their hair, and untie their shoelaces, all while mocking them.",
			"A piano crashes down 1d4 meters away from a party member. It must have been pushed off the balcony of that nearby building. But who would toss a piano out of a balcony?",
			"A person explodes in a gout of fire. Then 2 more nearby. A creature is possessing these victims before they ignite. Then the creature turns on the players! It could be that the victims (or at least one of them) are connected somehow. Are there more victims throughout the city? It’s clear that the heroes must find this out before it happens again!",
			"Household ‘Otto-Servant’ warforged automatons have recently become a trend among the well to do. Their inventor sends a message to the players asking for help using an unassuming middleman as a messenger. It seems the inventor fears for their life, as they narrowly escaped a lethal attack by one of their inventions! Tales of similar attacks spread like wildfire the following days – copycat attacks seem to be happening! Can the players protect the life of the inventor, and discover the conspiracy behind the attacks?",
			"A rag-picker with his towering cart of discards rushes into your path. They stumble on a cobblestone, bringing the entire trolley crashing down on the street. You see glints amongst the strewn linen and furs …",
			"A promoter catches sight of the party and seizes the opportunity. Each player must take a DC 10 CHA check or have a wristband for the all new bar ‘The Whore’s Shoe’.",
			"A throng of protestors block the road, bearing banners with slogans such as ‘Ditch the Witch’ and ‘The hag’s a hack’. The leaders of the group, a human druid in an impressive headdress, and a dwarf Bard with a powerful voice are getting the frustrated crowd riled up with a powerful speech about the decadence, intransigence and failures of the powers that be.",
			"A few guards march past with a scrawny street urchin in tow. The child is manacled and clearly in pain.",
			"An unkempt mage is staring at a lamppost, seemingly transfixed. He stands with a relaxed posture and smells of ozone",
			"You spot a fruit seller dragging a cart through a solid wall and vanish. Inspecting the wall, it appears to just be the solid outer wall of a general store",
			"A street artist is making portraits for a reasonable price. The images seem to have a life of their own, with the faces smiling and winking at passersby. Some complete examples on the flagstones around him showing detailed backgrounds and activity but no actual muse. None the less the frames have the ‘depicted’ individuals name painted in gold letters.",
			"3 drunk students from the mage’s college are causing a ruckus in the street, causing hijinks and hilarity with their cantrips. One of them takes issue with the PCs, mistaking them for a reviled enemy. The gang tries to assert their dominance and challenges the enemy and their ‘minions’ to a fight.",
			"A pack of (2d4 +2) rabid dogs bursts from an alley, directly in the path of the party.",
			"A chieftain born aloft on his vast shield by the shoulders of four tattooed warriors is rushed through the crowd, tailed by a Dwarf with a winged helm and a Goliath in striped pantaloons.",
			"A man in long white stockings with a glamorous golden quiff and accompanied by a small white dog disturbs the party to ask them if a hairy man with a black beard wearing a tricorne hat has been through here. Apparently, the man has stolen something very dear to him and must be found at once.",
			"A masked figure in a billowing black cloak leaps across the street from one rooftop to another. Their polished black mail gleams in the light. A smaller figure in a colorful leather jerkin with a quarterstaff strapped to their back jumps after him.",
			"You walk past an elite’s compound as an angsty looking teenager emerges from a side-gate. They glance at the players and slouches off. After a minute or so banshee like screams emerge from the building…",
			"A building is being demolished on the street. The wrecking crew are on a break.",
			"A panicked crowd stampedes down the street. In the havoc you see innocents stumble and be crushed by the terrified crowd. Through the wails and screams you can hear one word: Giant.",
			"A sewer collapses into a sinkhole during heavy rains. Half of a neighborhood is now thirty feet underground. In a poor one: many people may be trapped beneath the rubble and possibly drowning. but only a few heroes care enough to try and save the victims. Will those greedy land-developers get their way and clear out those dirty poor people once and for all? Was this part of a planned attack? In a wealthier neighborhood: a few gold-pieces and trinkets hint that the sinkhole may hide a treasure cache; a wealthy noble might mourn the loss of their precious object-d’art and pay the heroes to delve the hole to retrieve it. Anywhere: a small horde of 3d6 low-level semi-intelligent sewer monsters emerge, shouting abuse at the ‘sky-demons’ who just invaded their home; swarms of vermin; slip-and-slides; and a labyrinthian network of secret tunnels!",
			"A drug addict pleads for money from the players. He is suffering from the shakes, with his eyes darting in separate directions. He stammers unintelligibly in a hoarse voice, wringing his hands desperately. If the players don’t help him out, it is revealed the addict is possessed by a Shadow Demon. He has the same stats as a commoner with +2 to DEX, INT, and CHA. He has the same resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities and abilities as a Shadow, and knows the spell Deeper Darkness and Shadow Evocation."

			"A large family of gnomes. They are quite welcoming to guests, and serve dishes upon dishes of rich, steaming food at their meals, often accompanied by the father and the older sons singing.",
			"A young tiefling loner who’s willing to share his small, spartan flat. A starving-artist type (well, not quite starving, he does pretty well) who specializes in portraits. He doesn’t bother the guests if they don’t bother him. Keeps his work depicting who he remembers as his mother (an Erinyes) in a safe in his room.",
			"A soft-spoken Half-orc librarian and his wife, an Elvish herbalist. She isn’t as welcoming as him, but is alright with guests as long as they stay out of the workshop. They both do some of the cooking, so the meals are…unique.",
			"A Kobold matriarch. While her children have all moved out, their children are dropped off at Grandma’s house quite frequently, and she teaches them all she knows. She also runs a small shrine to Bahamut in the cellar.",
			"A hot-headed, wealthy heiress and her more rational lady-in-waiting.",
			"The prince of a corroding noble line, of late taken to dressing in black, composing gloomy poems, and brooding on the battlements of his manor.",
			"A dwarvish professor with a magnificent walrus mustache, as well as his warm, old-fashioned wife (a dressmaker) and their daughter, who’s visiting for a month or so from her apprenticeship.",
			"The quiet Mother of a hostel run by the temple of the god of the poor. The tragedy and despair of many of her visitors has rubbed off on her a little. The food is outstanding.",
			"A not-quite-right young man with ambitions to become a psychologist. Asks far too many personal questions, then goes off on rants about what he thinks shaped his guests to the people they are today. Total quack psychologist, doesn’t know what he’s saying at all.",
			"An Eladrin who’s spending a few centuries ‘indulging in kindness’. There’s a too-good-to-be-true air to the stay. Breakfast in bed, indoor training arena, a small dungeon built underneath the manor and stocked with inexpensive monsters, a wizard’s study, everything they could possibly want. And the host is always smiling.",
			"A jovial Goliath with an Australian accent who spends most of his time wrestling with various dangerous forms of wildlife. Owns a large merchant company, spends most of his time doing push-ups or lifting weights or wrestling yetis.",
			"A shriveled, wrinkled, hobbling old Bullywug whose sentences are out of order, and seems to speak in riddles. He wears a slightly threadbare robe and carries a walking stick.",
			"A stern Halfling dance instructor. She’s quite sprightly, humming waltz tunes as she works. She corrects people’s postures out of force of habit.",
			"An old Dragonborn mercenary who frequently lapses into a thousand-yard-stare. While not tormented by nightmares, he’s a good-humored guy with quite a few tips on adventuring.",
			"A water genasi weaver whose skill isn’t quite unmatched, but it’s up there. Naturally, the curtains and carpets of his house are expertly made and quite flamboyant.",
			"A cackling, bitter old woman. Actually a Green Hag, and her curse is the reason the couple next door (whom she finds insufferable) have been trying for a child for years without success. Serves stew or porridge for every meal from a huge, battered-looking black cauldron.",
			"A hard-as-nails half-elf rancher. Owns stables upon stables of pure-bred racing horses. Despises city-slickers.",
			"An old Minotaur noble. He wears huge suits, custom-made for him, and has a staff of Animated Objects who sing, dance, and make dinner.",
			"A slightly suspicious young woman. Knows far too much about weapons, disappears for long periods of time, and locks the basement door very heavily. She’s an assassin for a local gang of racketeers, and will skip town if she’s found out.",
			"An Animated Armor that speaks like the Discworld golems (That Is, She Talks Like This) and moves very jerkily. She (well, it’s built for a female humanoid) used to work for an evil artificer before a band of adventurers gave her full free will. Knows a thing or sixty-four about dungeoneering, and considers herself indebted to all adventurers.",
			"A goblin horse-jockey who loves nothing more than the thrill of a race. Talks a mile a minute, usually boasting about his races, and his house is full of trophies that he polishes devoutly.",
			"A human card-sharp who won his entire house in a game of Triple Ogres. He’s married to the shrewd but not very welcoming owner of a local tavern. She brings home the latest gossip each night.",
			"A kobold artificer who’s trying to turn his species’ natural affinity for mechanisms to the good. Owns all sorts of fascinating contraptions, like an automatic pencil-sharpener or a tiny construct that writes down any good ideas he has mid-conversation.",
			"A merry old smuggler, although he’s put his pirating days behind him aside from the odd chorus of Dead Man’s Chest. His house is adorned with model ships and sketches of exotic shores. Drinks strong home-brewed grog.",
			"The town doctor. There’s something odd about her of late. She stays up past midnight, tends to skip meals, and always seems to be tearing up some piece of paper and tossing it in the trash. (She’s smitten with the blacksmith’s apprentice, but can’t bring herself to tell him.)",
			"A rough-and-ready frontier-dwelling female Dwarf, who lives in a quaint cottage. She’s older than most of the village, and knows all the skills of the hinterlands: medicine, hunting, cooking, the lot.",
			"An old man who can’t seem to look you in the eye. He has one craft, and one craft only: he’s a knife maker. Assassins from every syndicate, court or gang come to him for their daggers. Even the odd Drow comes in the dead of the night to buy an honest-to-Lolth Master Work dagger.",
			"A scheming duke who tries to see if the party thinks his power-plays would work without hinting too obviously at his massive ambitions.",
			"A satyr couple who are, well, typical satyrs. They love wine, music, food, the usual revel stuff. Enjoy having guests, of course, but can’t stand ‘sticks in the mud’, ‘killjoys’ or ‘introverts’.",
			"A female Drow who left the Underdark because she’s claustrophobic. Polite, in a regal sort of way. Her house doesn’t have hallways so much as long, broad halls, with bookcases or coffee tables or armchairs.",
			"A newer vampire who is having a little bit of an identity crisis. He gets the ‘nocturnal’ part, yes, he gets that, but isn’t the whole ‘domination’ thing a little unethical? and similar conversation. Keeps forgetting that garlic tastes disgusting to him now.",
			"The best Dwarvish pastry-chef that has ever walked the earth. And she knows it. Quite boastful.",
			"The keeper of a local shrine to the fire god. He’ll just sit by the fireplace, staring into it for hours on end. Has a very large and overly friendly golden retriever.",
			"The local ‘crazy cat lady’. An Air Genasi whose hair is always blowing in a gentle breeze. This confuses her cats to no end. She has forty-three of them, and one Mimic who enjoys it’s current lifestyle and has decided to stay shaped like a cat.",
			"A Tabaxi game-warden. His wolfhound isn’t part wolf, it’s part Displacer Beast, which means people often think he has two dogs. Pleasant but fairly quiet.",
			"A grizzled old human war veteran. Wears an eye-patch. Has a suit of plate-armor stained with horrific, otherworldly humors in his front hall. Retired after ridding his ancestral estate of some kind of great beast he refuses to describe.",
			"A gnomish scientist who studies modrons. He’s utterly fascinated by them, and can go on for hours with horrifically dull facts and factoids about them. His house is littered with mounted modrons, dissected modrons, everything modron-related you could imagine.",
			"A time-wizard who messes with his personal time for kicks. Making himself twelve years old, being in four places at once. He thinks it’s a riot. His house is full of books of temporal magic, or at least it was, twelve minutes before you try to open one of them. Opening one book makes them all vanish to the past. It’s his security system.",
			"A noble Knight Lord who lives in a small castle and commands an order of chivalrous Knights. A former adventurer.",
			"A wise Grand Wizard who lives in a magic tower and commands a guild of powerful Wizards. A former adventurer.",
			"A clever Spymaster who lives in a heavily-secured manor and commands a guild of Spies. A former adventurer.",
			"A pious High Priest of Light who lives in a modest house attached to a glorious Temple. A former adventurer.",
			"A homely man with balding white hair, a small beard and eyeglasses. Meets with friends often, talking for hours in the cellar. Are they…acting? Playing some sort of dice-game? It’s not quite clear. Says he hails from the realm of Greyhawk.",
			"An elvish professor of languages who, despite having fought in several wars, is a honorable, straight-laced, old-fashioned gentleman. He’s writing a rather long book. Apparently it’s about halflings and some kind of Ring?",
			"A razor-witted Dwarvish comedian who does standup at local taverns, dishing out the side-clutchers and knee-slappers galore. Willing to share a few jokes with the party, too. His ‘why did the cockatrice cross the road?’ always gets ’em.",
			"A Bugbear leg-breaker for the local mob is trying way too hard to be polite and gracious. His apartment’s nice, of course, but he seems to think that the entire party are some sort of sting operation.",
			"A former Underdark delver, this calm but dispassionate female Tiefling is married to a far more bubbly and cheery Wood Elf. They bicker regularly about what ‘acceptable decorations’ are, stuffed Troglodyte heads or singing roses.",
			"A brawny whiskey-maker who meets over a nice, old keg with rogues and grave-robbers every night, it seems. His house is above his tavern.",
			"An Eladrin woodcarver who has recently taken up trying to enchant things. She’s terribly confident it’ll work out eventually, but for now you’ll have to put up with wooden busts that hurl abuse or curse words and cutlery that work together to spell out rather rude slang.",
			"A Halfling balloonist with a terrible case of wanderlust. Half of his things haven’t been unpacked yet, half of them are already ready to go.",
			"A master wizard who crafts Golems. Has some shady deals with dungeon overlords, but is still a good man. Might cut the Evil Overlords off from his business if approached; he’s a man of principles, just needs a push of sorts to get him to stand his ground for them.",
			"An Aasimar teamster who’s moving into the song business. He’s got quite the voice, and a few songs already written: All Shook Up, 500 Miles, and he’s working on a few more.",
			"A slightly edgy Tiefling who wants to be both friendly and intimidating. Budding metalhead. His apartment is nearly plastered with band posters and song lyrics.",

			"A curious young man enamored by the sea. Despite his youth, his hair is receding. He never seems to blink, either. His house is full of weird idols and jewelry of ancient civilizations.",
			"A charlatan ‘wizard’ who’s really just a chemist. Tries to keep her lab hidden. Nearly has a breakdown if she’s confronted about her fraud.",
			"A Goliath strongman of the local circus. His quarters are rather large, because he’s rather large. They’re right next to the acrobats’ and the lion tamer’s.",
			"A vain elvish wizard who spends most of her time in front of her magic mirror, and the rest of it complaining about upload schedules and dislike mobs and ad revenue.",
			"A dwarvish butcher. His wife is an author. Both of his daughters are in preschool. He himself is vegetarian, but does eat fish. Spends his evenings playing pool in the cellar with his friends, or going on walks with his daughters.",
			"A professional court-jester of the local duke or lord. Not as cheery off the job; gripes to anyone who’ll listen about his poor wages and difficult job. His house is a small cottage within the bailey of the castle.",
			"A tight-lipped priest who seems to have a shrine to every god in his tiny house. The hallways are crammed with altars and icons, and the whole place smells like incense 24/7.",
			"An unintentionally insufferable Aasimar ballerina. Lets the guests have the run of the kitchen; she’s too busy practicing for her next performance in the studio downstairs.",
			"A young bachelor Mountain Dwarf, who’s bitter about getting turned down by the local army or militia. He’s drinking a little more than is good for him.",
			"A gnomish jeweler, his wife and three children. They have a pretty large townhouse. The husband is a little busy with an important order: a new crown for an anonymous nobleman.",
			"A halfling priest of various gods of knowledge and nature. He’s a part-time biologist, running a few experiments in the lab in his basement. He’d love to meet a Druid or Ranger with more hands-on experience than himself.",
			"A Fey who lives in a checkers-themed tower. May kick the guests out if they mention chess or use chess analogies. Most of the food is circular (pie, pancakes, etc.), the tablecloths and bedsheets all have checkered patterns. Writes long letters to a bitter rival.",
			"A Fey who lives in a chess-themed tower. Gets rather testy if people mention checkers. The staff are construct automatons that only move like particular chess pieces. Complains about a completely irrational rival who sends him storms of nonsense letters every day.",
			"A professional human trick-shot-archer. She goes on tour with the circus now and then. Her favorite one is nailing a playing card out of someone’s hand from one hundred paces.",
			"A stout Dwarf who’s a master cook. He puts his heart and soul into every slab of beef, taking hours just to prepare them for barbecuing. Doesn’t spend much time with the guests.",
			"A human former doctor (she’s still got the beak-mask hung up on the wall in an airtight case, and she warns the party that it’s quite contaminated) who retired after fighting some sort of otherworldly entity beneath her ancestral estate. Recently took up horse-riding.",
			"A human comedian whose jokes tend to be at his own expense. Unmarried but pretty well-off, for a comedian. He tends to leave in the evening and come back close to midnight after his show.",
			"An eladrin priest of Tymora. Closer to his fey ancestry than most Eladrin. He’s scheming with a local gang to spring some of their hooligans from prison- after all, the whims of chance are unpredictable, or so he’ll say if the party threatens to inform the authorities. Then he will try and bribe them.",
			"A calm Oriental-looking man who works as a janitor during the day. His apartment isn’t exactly barren, but it’s certainly unextravagant. He’s teaching a local child the various martial arts he mastered in his time as a Monk.",
			"A simple Halfling herb-farmer. She has a small plot of land behind her house, where she grows things like spices and vegetables. Patient, because as she says, you can’t hurry peppers. Spends most of her time reading novels.",
			"A dragonborn tale-weaver. No, not an author, she’s quite firm. A tale-weaver, the kind that don’t get written down so much as passed along. Though she doesn’t exactly have it in writing, she’s very familiar with the wording and themes that make a riveting tale.",
			"A solemn, gods-fearing Dwarvish carpenter. They call him the Pious Benchmaker, which baffles him. His wife is of somewhat better cheer, but tolerates no nonsense in her house. The furniture is first-rate. You could hit it with a battle-hammer and it wouldn’t dent.",
			"An Aasimar mattress-maker. Laments his own misfortune: his mattresses are so good, he either sleeps on them and can’t get himself out of bed, or he sleeps on a couch or armchair and doesn’t sleep well. It’s a DC X Strength save to get off his guest-beds (the best ones, for he’s quite hospitable), where X is 10 plus the number of days since the sleeper has been in a normal bed instead of a bedroll or cot.",
			"A slightly unhinged half-orc scholar. He’s studying all sorts of bizarre phenomena at once, and keeps a wall covered in notes, sketches, and pieces of twine connecting them. The statistical anomalies of coin flips, the way the planet is tilted, all those sorts of things. Frequently becomes so engrossed in his studies he forgets to eat.",
			"A ratcatcher who is quite ferocious in his task. He’s got mousetraps all over the place, and hundreds of rat skulls nailed to his wall. Grim, adamant, and talks at length about what utter vermin rodents are.",
			"A friendly, jocular doppelganger illusionist and it’s tame mimic pets. The house appears to have a large staff of servants and much finely-made furniture…",
			"A gnomish Expert Clown. He doesn’t just study mere tossing and tumbling, mind you. He studies the psychology of clowning. What makes a pie to the face so funny? Or what is the thrill-inducing factor of juggling eggs? He can tell you. He can tell you for several hours.",
			"A human stone-carver and his teenage son. The son’s a little worried about his father, as the latter seems to be losing interest in the craft. Their house is full of half-finished works.",
			"A high elf mask-maker. It’s a delicate craft, she’ll tell you. Fey come to call every so often, picking up their masks but also staying to chat with her a bit. So do some actors. And one or two assassins.",
			"A scruffy human gravedigger. He isn’t exactly a philosopher, but tends to make incisive remarks about mortality and time. Doesn’t like elves, because they don’t give him business.",
			"An old man with a bald head and gleaming eyes. If asked, he only gives his profession as ‘chemist’, and spends a lot of time in his lab. He’s less harmless than he seems; he’s the master poison-brewer for a local assassin’s guild. If he’s found out, he calls in his allies on whoever discovered his true identity.",
			"A young couple of a Tiefling and an Aasimar. Their ancestors didn’t like the marriage much, and it couldn’t exactly get officiated by a priest (but the local marriage law did allow for a Fey to do the job). They’re getting along fine.",
			"A pious couple who are gravely concerned about their young daughter. She claims to see ‘shadowy people’ in the cellar, and apparently brought the family dog back to life. They’re both nearly nervous wrecks, and priests of every Good god have been coming and going all week to try and exorcise the child.",
			"A white-haired old man and his shrill wife, both the village healers, although the Mr. recently got fired by the prince whose father he used to work for.",
			"A playwright who is outraged at his rivals trying to spread the rumor that his work was ghostwritten for him. Insists on reading off sonnets and scenes to the guests to prove that he’s genuine.",
			"A grizzled, scarred town guard. He’s only in during the day, usually asleep, and spends the nights walking the streets and smoking very particular cheap cigars. Moody but not hostile.",
			"A ‘professional quest-giver’ who pampers the heroes with everything he can. He’s in kahoots with a local dungeon-lord, and gets a share of the armor, weapons and loot of the heroes killed in the dungeon he directs them towards. He’ll take to the hills if he’s found out.",
			"A young priestess of a god of the wilds. Her house is on the very outskirts of town, and has a terrible case of rats, which she doesn’t mind as long as they don’t bother the guests. Rats that do bother the guests get speared. She doesn’t take nonsense, but has some sense of humor.",
			"A Kenku minstrel who rents a room above the tavern he performs in. It’s covered in posters from his ‘glory-days’- although a keen eye (DC 15 Investigation) will note that they’re actually other bards’ posters, with the minstrel’s name altered into them.",
			"An apprentice baker and his wife, a schoolteacher. Their house was a cheap deal, and is a little run-down but still serviceable. Gets a little drafty, though.",
			"A Kobold who claims to be an architect and interior designer. Actually, she’s a dungeon planner who designs catacombs, lairs and castles galore. Highly sought-after by evil overlords, and frantically tries to direct them away while the guests are there. If she’s found out, she’ll flee to the safety of one of her closer creations.",
			"A Swordsmith who has been at it for years. He keeps a display case of splintered, shattered or blunted swords recovered from various dungeons and battlefields, each with the tale of a fallen hero attached to it.",
			"A halfling gourmand with an affinity for candies. He’s a longstanding foe of witches who use his creations, or mockeries thereof, to lure children into their cook-pots.",
			"A Dwarvish family of four- father, mother, son, daughter -who are rather new in town. Hospitable, but the house is still full of moving crates. The father is a lumberjack, the mother is a stay-at-home parent.",
			"The High Priest of a local shrine of the god of travelers and messengers. He’s an unmatched source of information, references and road maps, and will greet anybody with a smile so long as they return the favor.",
			"An old Elvish couple. The husband spends most of his time golfing or whittling, the wife is busy giving advice to her newly-married daughter. They live in a nice old house, although there’s a ghost in the attic. Don’t worry, it’s very polite during the day, and it can’t leave the attic."

			"Three old geezers sat around a table for four. They won’t let anyone take the empty forth stool. The barkeep steps in if anyone objects. They have a tab even if such a facility isn’t available to all. They never seem to order but the drinks arrive at a steady rate. Always 4. One each and one in front of the empty stool.

He now prepares incredibly delicious breads, muffins, and other doughy goodies.",
			"Darlan the Human – a swarthy, golden-eyed man with dark hair drinks alone at the bar. With very little provocation, he will inform you he isn’t a Tiefling, and that he was just born looking a little different. His grandfather was a priest of the sun god.

			"Thorkhomtam, The Everraiding – a mummy king who when awoken took to the seas to build an eternal empire on the waves. His ships are fashioned after Egyptian river boats and are manned by skeletons with mummy captains. He pelts ships with flaming arrows before raming and boarding and refuses to use cannons.",
			"Gold-Thumbed Lizzie – A pursor and quartermaster, so named because ‘she holds on to coins so tight they become part’ve her thumb!’",
			"Jem the Angel-eyed – A half-elf with a beautiful, serene face and a strange penchant for murder. Jem is quiet and eerily calm, even in the middle of a battle. He once slipped into a city port and killed seventeen guards and a customs official, put all the bodies in one room, then left a pile of gold equal to the bounty on his head on top of them.",
			"First mate Crumblefist – A grey dwarf pirate whose crew was lost following a river out of the underdark and now seeks a crew to take him back through the dangerous waters to return home.",
			"Captain Durango Black – Tiefling captain of the Daring Demon. This terrifying swashbuckler is also famous among cutthroats and low lives for being a talented Bard, often telling stories of the devil captain so scary, he can harm men with insults.",
			"Captain Syrian Blackhand, human captain of The Ocelot – Made a pact with the god of the seas. His ship is the fastest in the world, but every year he must return to the temple where the accord was struck and cut off one finger. His left hand has only the thumb left.",
			"Pennington Pugwash – a human fighter with wrinkled, scrunched up face. Doesn’t have real athority on the ship but will still bark orders at people when they’re slacking off. Spends his time eating hardtack biscuits and cleaning muck out from between his skin folds.",
			"Leon – once a very young boy traveling with his parents on the cheap via cargo ship. When the ship was attacked by pirates and his parents were killed he was taken in by the pirates as they couldn’t bear to kill him. Now a young man, he has a complicated relationship with piracy and the captain he serves under. It’s the only life he’s known since he was young, and the crew treats him like family, but he can’t help but feel a bit resentful, and wants something more from life.",
			"Annie the Red – a young halfling woman with bright red flowing hair. She is as beautiful as she is ruthless. She may not be the strongest of the crew she is part of, but she is the lightest on her feet (And the lightest with her fingers). A girl who will charm you for an evening, steal your coinpurse, and still leave you wanting more.",
			"Half-Blood Harry – Huge and hulking, with impressive tattoos and scars, Harry is someone who makes himself known the instant he enters a room. Largely silent, one could mistake him for a stupid man- in truth he is shrewdly clever and prefers to listen. No one is really sure what his other ‘half’ is… goliath? Cyclops? Giant? Who knows? He is not telling.",
			"Laurabelle Lee – a woman of refinement as well as class. She runs the tightest and most efficient ship possible. Every uniform is starched, every button is shiny, even the brig is clean. Laurabelle herself is a stately figure in beautiful high-low dresses with tall leather boots and tight curls on her head. She is charming, but demands respect- and her crew love her as much as they fear her.",
			"Quartermaster Berrick – a gnome who is as ruthless as he is small, rarely leaves his office aboard his ship and has mounted a large crossbow pointing at his door in case of disappointing news. While he avoids going into battle himself, his bravery and cunning is unparalleled when he’s once again in the thick of it.",
			"Dragnet – a ruthless goblin captain who’s rise to infamy came with his acquisition of a cursed fishing net. His crew is an assortment of loyal goblins and men and women who have been captured and enthralled by the net. He is clever and quick to start a fight, though quicker to use his expendable crew to save his own life. The colors of his ship depict a crescent moon with a net strung over the bottom tip.",
			"Captain Barnical Horn – a tiefling captain who was keelhauled for so long that barnicals grew from his horns now he runs in search of all of his past crew.",
			"Rubidoo – the outgoing triton jester of a large pirate crew. Since the crew hates bad puns and witty jokes, they tend to often throw her overboard to get their laughs. Because of this, she has a clockwork arm, replaced after a shark bite. Rubidoo tends to put all sorts of prank hands on her cybernetic limb, including one that lets go of its index finger when you pull it. Despite the torture from the pirates, she tends to be all fun and laughs, believing her sole job in life is to be comedic.",
			"Captain Sjondeil Darhringur – A stoic faced captain who’s been on a boat since he was born. His heritage is unclear. He captains ‘The Watcher’ a bleak storm gray galleon with grey sails. He is almost always found staring out to the horizon waiting for something that only he understands.",
			"Gulliper ‘Gully’ Blackwater – A festive halfing raider of the coastal swamps and the last son of the cursed Blackwater family. He is an amicable enough sort, willing to spare those who surrender, though he has a habit of killing any he suspects of holding magical artifacts.",
			"Honorable Captain McQuane – A former naval officer who was captured. Instead of being ransomed or killed, he led a mutiny and rose through the ranks to captain. He found piracy to his liking, but runs the tightest ship on the seas. Legend has it his crew get only an hour of shore leave a year. He’s more than willing to accept surrender or do mercenary work, and is remarkably civil and polite. He insists on being referred to by his full title.",
			"Decker – a young teen in loose fitting clothes that swabs the deck. Eager to learn the trade of being a pirate, he’s often given the work that the other seamen see as below them. He escaped a life on the street in big town and seems appreciate having a place to sleep and food to eat.",
			"Loud Tom – A boatswain with a voice like a bull and a vocabulary that is truly impressive in its creativity and range, Loud Tom hurls profanity and insults at his crew and everyone else nearly constantly. The one exception is when he is truly angry- while his verbal abuse is mostly good-natured and verbose, his wrath is nearly silent, accompanied by a facial expression that can freeze grog. ‘Loud Tom is quiet’ is a whispered warning that goes through the ship like fire and leaves everyone desperate to stay out of his way.",
			"Broadwick the Penitent – an Aasimar Swords bard with the gleam of hatred in her eyes. She killed her angelic patron in a fit of passion and sails the seas in search of a place the guilt cannot reach. Carries a Wand of Smiles that she uses on her victims just before she takes their lives.",
			"Gelionexxitrus – A beholder that lives below deck on a fleshy, living, aberration boat. Chuul patrol the deck, twitching warped humanoids work the sails. It’s hard to tell whether Gelionexxitrus and the boat are the same being.",
			"The Silence – A thousand year old mummy lord who travels in a bubble of silence hundreds of feet wide. Wrapped around her neck is a pendant that allows her to speak and cast spells.",
			"The Beekeeper – A friendly half elf druid. His ship is loaded down with apiaries. He steals to support his bees. If asked any questions about his motivations he replies ‘Bees are dying at an alarming rate.’",
			"Arianis – A mad fey satyr looking for the best partiers on the material plane. Invitations to their week long hedonistic boat parties are more akin to kidnappings. If you fail to impress, you become the centerpiece/victim of the last night of the party.",
			"Revar the Fallen – An arrogant fallen Aasimar, who is easily enraged. He hates the Gods and every Culture, that still devote themselves to them in some form or fashion. He likes to especially raid temples and holy Cities.",
			"The Dread Pirate Jazeera; Captain – A dusty skinned, half-elven woman of breathtaking beauty, with black hair and supple frame. She can convince most anyone of most anything, using either intimidation or allure. She captains The Indomitable, a large ship constructed of ebonized woods. Started her seafaring life in search of the pirates who press-ganged her father into servitude, and chose piracy as a (somewhat ironic,) means to an end. Several years on, and with no leads in sight, she has all but abandoned hope of finding her father alive, and has instead turned her focus to attaining power, often through morally grey means, and plans to take revenge for her loss.",
			"Garrett; First Mate – A halfling with sandy brown locks of shoulder length hair, and an emerald for his left eye. Originally a stowaway, Jazeera saw his quick wit and cunning to be a useful trait, as he seemed able to talk himself out of nearly any corner, a fine ally to have. After sailing with her for several years, they went their separate ways, as Garrett, trained as a rogue, longed for the stage, rather than the shadows. After several years training as a bard, fate brought the two back together, and Garrett, who had lost his eye during his adventures without Jazeera, was re-instated as first mate.",
			"John; Quartermaster – A towering human male, with a few arcane tricks up his sleeve, John and Jazeera have a seething distaste for each other on the surface, but there is a mutual respect for the two in battle. John tends to err on the law and good when moral questions come up, which can often run counter to Jazeera’s plans. While the two often get into it, Jazeera recognizes power and quality when she sees it, and knows that her ship is better with John as her tactician and enforcer.",
			"Varic; Lead Gunner – A half-elven sorcerer with an affinity for lightning, Varic knows all about how to calculate the trajectory necessary to decimate his foes. As such, he was an obvious choice to lead the gunning crews. When casting spells, his veins surge with arcane energy, visible beneath the surface of his skin.",
			"Puddles; Powder Monkey – A dwarven barbarian with a fire red beard, who follows orders and has no fear, it’s natural that he’d take on one of the most dangerous job on the ship. Powder Monkeys are responsible for carrying the gunpowder for the gunning crews, and as they often had explosives in their arms, were often in a very dangerous position, should something be mishandled or dropped.",
			"Ragnar; Cook – An older man who questions his purpose and existence in life, but has a taste for food. With a long white beard and a barrel-chest, Ragnar can often be found snacking on his favorite food: chicken. Despite his aged appearance and apparent senility, Ragnar is a capable fighter when the chips are down; doubly so if his chicken is threatened.",
			"Captain Longhorn – A Minotaur pirate captain with a peg leg, long horns, and a grand, flowing beard. He carries the ship’s wheel on his back and uses it as a shield. If he’s not at the helm, the ship doesn’t move.",
			"Smeagle – A conniving, craven bo’sun of a disreputable ship, this stunted aarakocra’s wings were clipped when he was exiled from the sky.",
			"Elondrith the Puppeteer – a shady looking mass of dark rags, sporting a mask of ancient porcelain. The crew is said to be immortal, even after being hit by countless arrows and heavily woumded, they run fearlessly into their enemies arms flailing their weapons. Strangely though, they always try to aim for the arms and legs to only incapacitate their foe. Noone has ever heard elondrith utter a single command, only gestures. This is the reason they call him the puppeteer.",
			"Broggy the Vile – a half giant that assembled a crew of demihumans. Minotaurs, half orcs, goblins, you name it. Hes said to be ruthless and cruel to his foes, but fatherlike to his crew. His main weapon is a huge spiked iron ball on a chain. He is said to have sunken a pitatehunters ship by throwing his weapon once, destroying the mast and ripping a hole into the deck of the ship.",
			"Joe, no other names, just Joe – He had joined the ship as a boy, seeking fortune and fame. Over the years he toiled on deck, in the rigging, on the guns. He knows every single board and nail on this ship from bow to stern. Joe had seen his share of action, losing two fingers on his left hand in a sword fight when he was 20, his right ear in a deck fire at 25, all the toes on his right foot while sailing around the cape at 30, yet he carried on. Through his time on board, Joe developed a rigourous discipline. His white hair is kept short, cut with his own knife, and he is clean shaven despite the deep wrinkles on his aging leathery face. ‘No sense being pretty when you’re dead!’ he would say. When drunk, Joe tells stories of his time at sea, all 50 years of it. Each story has a tattoo to go with it, his skin a veritable tapestry of his life etched from his knuckles to his neck and down to his ankles. As for rank, Joe never cared for it, command was not his thing. Still, he often takes youngsters under his wing, teaching them the ropes, keeping them out of trouble. Even the captain looks up to Joe, often taking his guidance on the more complicated nautical and tactical matters. Joes advanced years did nothing to diminish his fighting ability. His ability with a cutlass is second to none and twinned with his knowledge of ships he can turn an advantage in any fight at sea. And pray you never meet the loud end of his flintlock. Nobody has ever seen him miss and lived to tell the tale.",
			"Captain Mangan – an old long-bearded man with a lot of scars. He doesn’t own a ship but claims to be a former leader of a smuggler guild. He has hidden his treasures in a secret place. He is a bit crazy and forgetful. A lot of statements where to find his treasures contradict themself. He is very proud and brags about it all the time.",
			"Jebadiah – A cabin boy who thinks himself much more important and sometimes threatening than he really is. He hates whenever someone brings up his lowly position, and thinks that he deserves more. Jebadiah tries to avoid danger whenever possible, but when his reputation is on the line will rashly leap into it.",
			"Left Shoe – A quiet, gnarled dwarf who slurs his words and drools slightly when he talks. He is clearly sick with something, and has lost much of his feeling. This has led to his killing people ‘to feel their lives.’",
			"Jim The Barber – A Captain, originally called James the Barbarous. Got tired of correcting people who misheard it and took up a pair of clippers out of curiosity. Now runs a very profitable side-business haircutting and beard trimming; it is fulfilling enough that Jim is considering giving up piracy altogether.",
			"Molly the Red and Captain Crookshanks – Molly was born on a pirate ship and has developed a fierce reputation as a daring and fearless captain. Byron Crookshanks, the second son of a minor Duke, joined the Eirinie Royal Navy and quickly rose to prominence as a fair and punctiliously honorable naval officer. Their rivalry was marked by close escapes, heated battles, and chases over half the known world. When Eirin was overwhelmed and swallowed by the Chriam Empire, Crookshanks and his crew refused to bend the knee, and found themselves a ship without a country. The two rivals became partners during a firefight with the Criamen Navy and were wed almost immediately thereafter. Now the parents of a half-dozen children, the two run a small fleet of privateers as the Eirinie Navy-in-Exile.",
			"The Lost Fisherman – possibly just a legend that pirates tell to scare each other, The Lost Fisherman is an old Dwarf in a fishing skiff, floating out in the middle of the ocean. They say he can see your soul. There was a ship, Sharkey’s Devil, that ran across him once- three hundred blackhearted pirate veterans. Another ship found the Devil a week later, floating aimlessly. The captain and crew were dangling from the yardarms, gaffed and strung together; like a grotesque fish market, they said. The only survivors were two prisoners and the grommit, who was crazy with fear, and never left land again when they got him back- a cobbler, he is now, and a pious man. But he’s just a story, a way to get scare pirates away, right? Right? I mean, there are other ships that have supposedly had similar fates, but it is probably a story. Yeah, that’s it. A story.",
			"Captain Scrack – The goblin captain of Scrack’s Scuttler (see the ship section). He has ‘VERMIN’ burned into his cheek like a brand. Scrack is a Chaotic Good captain who is well liked by his crew. He doesn’t discuss his past, but seems to take some joy in defeating haughty nobles.",
			"Vileem Crabshanks – A goblin pirate who would gladly avoid any search for treasure, yet adventure seems to find her. Has honest aspiration to become a merchant, but faces prejudice and misfortune.",
			"Koros the Black – A (Krynn) minotaur, who aims to ravage a town and personally loot the local Duke’s Manor. In truth, he’s only after a treasure lost by his grandfather to the Duke’s ancestors, but the Code of Honor demands blood must spill as well.",
			"Sharonogue the Trident — Few know his name, but Sharonogue is the clever and ruthless Sahuagin captain of a submersible with a fully amphibian crew. The submersible has a wreck of another pirate ship strapped to its hull. Sharongue scouts out his target with a pod of sharks, then when the moment is right, his spellcasters summon a thick fog. Out of the fog, the submersible rises, looking to the opposing vessel as if a ghost ship encrusted with mollusks and water-logged has apparated before them. The above-water portion can soak up the cannon fire from their desperate quarry but the submersible inexorably approaches until Sharonoques merciless crew can board.",
			"Gatsi Shrinemason – A Dwarven Cleric of Zeboim, who builds faith and worship among all sea-goers. You can find him at work in towns or the wilds, building shrines, alters, obelisks, spreading word; or maybe just bullying his way onto a ship to go where he’s called.",
			"Crablegs – a human deckhand that always walks sideways.",
			"Amir-Sual – Once a wealthy sea merchant of the oceans of Osad, he turned to piracy after it was discovered he had used privateers to sink his competition. He has managed to bind 2 jinn to his ship so as to conquer the opal sea: A wind jinn for his sails, and a fire jinn for makeshift cannon",
			"Rimmarie, first mate – Once a prostitute of some nowhere costal town, her life was saved by Amir when he was still just a crooked merchant, she stands by her now husband’s side on the opal sea. She is said to have made a deal with a dark jinn who wanted who helped bind two others to the ship.",
			"First Mate Shaw – a classic sword n’ board fighter with a few spell scrolls at his disposal. Shaw has a few dialogue quirks, if anyone bothers to talk to him. ‘I’m Shaw of it’ ‘How can you be sure? I’m Shaw!’",
			"Dashu – A long term priate deckhand. An impressive climber and prefers small sharp daggers. Very competent and finds places on crews easily. Secretly he is a wererat who is first to leave his crewmates to their fates the moment things go wrong. Even if it means living as a rat in the bilges of a military vessel until next port.",
			"Deathskull the Man Killer – This pirates real name is Phill, he’s a kind man who has bad luck all around him. If he helps out other ships they end up sinking and burning down, nothing good happens around him. He is known as a man killer even though he tries to be very kind.",
			"Captain Merriatt, Elven pirate of the Azure Sea – He hunts at night, catching ships completely off guard on moonless nights. His brutal reputation is totally manufactured, he hates bloodshed. His ship, The Death Night, a dark-hulled and black sailed schooner has an enchanted brig that creates a Duplicate of its prisoners on deck. Once a ship has been taken, Merriatt takes the captain below, then returns to ‘execute’ the Duplicate in front of the captured crew. After ransacking his victim’s ship, he lets the crew go on their way. The capture captains are let off at the next safe port, warned never to to reveal the truth, or risk the lives of every other captain on the Azure Sea.",
			"Rat-Faced Bill – Bill had a vision problem ever since a bully splashed boiling water in his face when he was 9. He squints to see and he looks like a rat when he squints. Unfortunately Bill had to squint a lot. He was bullied for so long that when he turned 16 he kidnapped every single one of the 13 people that bullied him and put them in a small dinghy with no sails and no oars and pushed them out to sea. Bill then decided to become a pirate as a way to support himself and to see if he could find the dinghy. Bill rules with an iron fist but he is always fair and so his crew has much respect for him. His favorite punishment is forcing prisoners to build a dinghy out of their former ship and pushing them out to sea.",
			"Arfinkle – Arfinkle is a crafty wizard with a wicked sense of humor and even more wicked spells. His entire crew is odd bronze contraptions, fueled equally by steam and twisted magic. His favorite one is a teapot with legs and a sleep dart shooter.",
			"Last Mate – Last Mate is a sailor by trade and probably among the worst to ever attempt it. By the time he calls out ‘Land Ho’ from the Crow’s Nest, he’s already forgotten in which direction it is by the time he’s scrambled down to the deck. Last Mate also happens to never really quite recall any nautical terms whatsoever and has to be constantly reminded what port and starboard mean. However, Last Mate’s relentless enthusiasm and deep respect for the Captain helps make him a tolerable, if not slightly detrimental, member of the crew.",
			"Obum the Breaker – Former naval captain. Charismatic and popular, but mostly inept. Relies heavily on his First Mate Ideen (a warlock serving the Devil Osouro) and his boatswain Hwonk the Vile.",
			"Mourning Dove – A tall and graceful captain whose husband, a sailor, was seduced by a woman on his ship and disappeared. Mourning Dove wears a white eye mask and kills all adult females on the boats she takes. Her crew is all male.",
			"Powdermonkey Conrad – a small halfling boy. He is an agile climber who was found on a piece of floating boat wreckage as a child. He is full of optimism and often pulls tricks on his crewmates, but is fiercely loyal.",
			"The Flamedancer – a goliath captain with the ability to create fire. He commonly attempts to throw fire at the sail of an enemy ship to immobilise it before getting close enough to burn the rest of the ship to surrender. Works with first mate Johnson, a sorcerer with the ‘Create or Destroy Water’ spell who control flames that spread too fast or put out a captured ship. He brutally burns any dissenters and enemy captains who fight in front of his crew, as a show of force, while Johnson stands by.",
			"Rosie the Rivener – A well built and fiercely independent woman who pioneered a form of maritime execution in which the victim is lashed between two ships that then sail apart, ripping the victim in half.",
			"The Dead Pirate Roberts – A skeleton that resides in the captain’s quarters of a pirate ship called the Death Jester. He’s not animated or anything, he’s really just a skeleton. The First Mate is a spellcaster who can speak with the dead, and frequently consults Roberts for advice.",

			"Toruvah Hullfinder – This man’s body ripples with muscle, and his hands are like oyster-hammers. He fights bare-handed, leaping into the water and tearing holes in enemy vessels. He has an odd penchant for collecting bits of driftwood.",
			"Bertha Redbraid, the Dwarven Sea Lass – Captain of the Dread Drakkar, a longship of dwarven construction. She loves looting and sinking vessels of Elvish make.",
			"Captain Koskinen – 6’7′ tall, 320lb tiefling with dark purple skin and a great many scars. He is barrel chested and imposing, with a deep and raspy voice, but he is actually a very warm and friendly host to guests aboard his ship, which sails the great desert at the head of a fleet of lost ships driven by a great sandstorm.",
			"Shivering Sally – Just what this pirate is is unclear, since she is always heavily bundled up and complaining of the cold. She clearly has some magical connection to ice, which makes her a dangerous opponent, but mostly she is notable for the betting pool on what race she is, and who will get a look to find out.",
			"Reversal of Fortune – A Goliath with a prominent burn scar along the right side of his face. Reversal of Fortune is a powerful swordsman and cunning captain. He is also subject to a powerful curse; every two years, he is destined to lose everything he owns. He is unaware of the curse, attributing his sudden biannual losses to bad luck or twists of fate.",
			"Captain Bismuth Von Hart – a green tiefling swashbuckler in search of a way to remove the curse he has obtained. Formerly a Halfing, Captain Hart sacrficed his own appear, gaining tainted blood in exchange for a magically item/secret from a haunted island far to the east.",
			"Marquis de Lafayette – a human sailor on his way to deliver news about the war effort of [insert country here]. On the weekends he does acapella with his crew. He loves whiskey, revolution, and women.",
			"Brinetusk – Orc captain of the Crackin’. Large and imposing, with a number of tattered jackets and hats taken from other captains he has defeated. His ship reflects her captain, with a number of masts and armor taken from Brinetusk’s victims grafted on to the hull. He attacks other ships on sight, crashing into them with the weight of the Crackin’ behind him, with his shamans upon their war drums, summoning storms of vengeance and destruction. Expect a great deal of plunder if Brinetusk is defeated, though some of it may be more trophies and skulls rather than gold or gems.",
			"General Taylor – once a high ranking officer of an empire (current or destroyed) he and his crew were sunk in an ambush (either pirates or an enemy kingdom) and woke up as an undead crew at the bottom of the sea. He continues to sail in his rotting galleon behind enemy lines, attacking anyone that looks like those who killed him.",

			"Ghingumuff Goldtaker – A clever and merciless goblin captain who boldly leads his crew to wealth and glory.",
			"Tavis Startoe – A human who lost an arm to a shark. With his remaining arm he wields the rapier like no other. He often mocks his foes as he duels for their inability to defeat a cripple.",
			"Topiary Fritz – a halfling man covered in new tattoos and wearing a captain’s robe several sizes too big for him. He was once the servant of a large military ship, but once the ship changed hands he just continued to work. He is incredibly kind, hardworking, and an incredibly competent chef and servant.",
			"James Rothschester (Great Old One warlock) – is a human pirate captain with short, shaggy black hair, and sunken spectral green eyes. He is less interested in treasure than he is information. He and his crew go to ancient ruins and underwater caverns in search of information about his patron. He only takes enough treasure to keep his crew happy and willingly gives up much of his share in return for their compliance.",
			"Elara ‘Forester’ – a druid torn between her love of the land and the sea. Her boat was grown of an ancient Riverside yew that wished to travel as much as she did. She hates the other ships that roam the ocean, those perverted abhorrations glued together from hundreds of innocent trees. Her ship, the ‘eldest pride’ is crewed exclusively by tree ents.",
			"Barnaby, The Barnacle – Widely believed to be the crustiest, oldest sea dog still in the business, Barnaby is an incredibly old human pirate that has made a name for himself by being the most experienced and well-traveled pirate still alive. He has been a crew member of a whole fleet of ships, having held the positions of cabin boy and captain at different points in his life, as well as everything in between. He is a knowledgeable sailor, having spent more of his life on a ship than off one, and is one of the most competent crew members a captain can hope for, with any counsel he provides consistently proving the worth his wealth of experience in piracy. However, it is worth remembering that a pirate doesn’t grow old unless they’re the cream of the crop, and The Barnacle has spent his whole life as one. He has a cunning mind that has only sharpened with age, and a vicious streak as long as a ship when the time calls for it. Many a raid has been planned with his help only for the captain in charge to disappear amidst the fighting, leaving Barnaby as the man to look to, and he has earned plenty of loot from his long years of work. The moniker ‘The Barnacle’ was not earned because of his fondness for them or their presence on his body, but because much like a barnacle, Barnaby is impossible to be rid of and will likely remain long after his foes are at the bottom of the sea. All this history has earned Barnaby a degree of infamy among the underground community, and any captain who brings him aboard treats him with the proper respect, deference, and fear to which someone in his position is entitled.",
			"Breaker of Ships – A Warforged gunner, BoS was created to serve as a living weapon for the (random country) navy. BoS slowly grew to hate this life, and when their ship was sunk in a squall, they walked along the bottom of the ocean, until they reached the infamous pirates haven, Shattersail Bay and enlisted with a crew. Now, when they are not blowing up (random country’s) ships, they are studying the occult, using their share of the booty to acquire dread occult artifacts.",
			"Lady Aliana Ismal – When the Hallowed Empire collapsed in the fires of revolution, the loyalist sailors and marines of the 2nd Hallowed Fleet found themselves without a cause or a leader. The former was fixed when Lady Aliana Ismal, a human warlock, arrived and seized control of the fleet with the aid of eldritch monsters, and her connection to the former royal family. Now the Unhallowed Fleet ravages the newly independent states out of a desire for loot and revenge. Rumor has it that Lady Ismal seeks to use the loot to acquire an army fit to restore the Empire to its former glory.",
			"High Priest Kandi – Kandi ( a dwarven priest) and his band of followers are disciples of the Ocean God, Leviathan. Kandi’s home island was once invaded by a ship full of greedy adventures, who were only repelled at great cost. In order to prevent future attacks, KAndi and a group of his acolytes were ‘blessed’ by Leviathan with the ability to turn into weresharks and sworn to protect the people of their island from future interlopers. Kandi’s crew maintains a small gallon in order to fool incoming ships, but this is a distraction to allow the weresharks to get close to the enemy boat and board. Most of the time Kandi is content to scare ships off, but sometimes he is forced to destroy ships with all hands aboard, in order to protect his home.",
			"Squabbles – a seemlingly timeless elf-ish man, though it’s hard to tell he’s an elf. His hunched back, yellowed fingernails and eyes, and wrinkled leathery skin almost looks monstrous from a distance. Speaks in a slurred Primordial that, even when understood, is not properly understood. He’s never been asked on the ship, and he always complains about ‘poor spoils,’ without ever asking for them. At port, he gets off the ship with the rest of the crew, and wanders back onto another ship, with no regard for loyalty of crew. Mediocre at washing, but entertaining, unique, and most importantly: free labor. However, captains are cautious of him, and some seem to listen exceptionally intently to his ramblings, sometimes even going so far as to invite him to sleep his ship duration in the captain’s quarters. Occasionally after a long night of slurred ramblings, captain’s may abruptly change their course, asking advice from the old crouch. Rarely do they find anything… that they speak of…",
			"Seeker Malorie – a halfling Deckhand with a badly scarred face, extending to the top of his head effecting his hair growth noticeably (think scraggly). he has a Flase eye that seems to just look around on its own, but quickly snaps into line with the other eye when someone mentions treasure.",
			"Rigmonkey Soliel – a half-elf girl who grew up in a traveling circus and was taken up by pirates after it burnt down. She dances up the rigging of the ship, keeping balance in the fiercest storms. She has a quick tongue and a fiery temper.",
			"Slick Willy – An enormous, intelligent eel who signs on with pirate crews, accompanying their ships to attack other craft from beneath the waterline and defend against aquatic threats in exchange for bodies thrown overboard.",
			"Teth-Makina – A githyanki pirate slumming it in the Prime Material, stealing gold on the open ocean rather than godflesh on the Astral Sea for a change of pace. Her ship’s figurehead is the actual head of a zombiefied dragon which breathes necrotizing green flames. Way overqualified for what she’s doing here.",
			"Deephost Margot – An aspiring pirate-queen who sought power through symbiosis with a creature of the lightless depths. She must consume alchemical drugs regularly, both to make her body an amenable environment for the creature and to sustain her organs crushed by its occupation of her torso, and in return gains access to its abyssal magic.",
			"Ulixes the Tidesworn – A sea-priest who pirates not for wealth, but to ritually enact the supremacy of water over land. A peerless navigator who finds his way by revelation rather than reason.",
			"Long Don Clamber – Born to a port whore and raised in the shadow of Jolly Rogers, has always dreamed of becoming the most infamous pirate the seven seas had ever seen. Has had impressive exploits as part of the crew of several notorious pirate captains, but never managed to afford a ship of his own due to blowing his earnings on magico-surgical alterations to make his form more piratey. Has a hook-hand that can fire off a grappling hook, gills and an organ that lets him drink seawater, a liver that can handle any amount of grog, expandable peg legs, a monkey’s tail attached to his back, and so on.",
			"Gurglesploosh – A water elemental playing at being a pirate, as it seemed like the most entertaining thing mortals did on the waater. Gurglesploosh doesn’t really understand important (to mortals anyway) concepts like “crime”, “ownership”, or “death”. Starting to enjoy the feeling of blood diluting within its body.",
			"First Mate Jeremy Jenkins – His captain has been dead for 5 years. Despite sailing with and leading the remaining crew, Jeremy hasn’t taken the captain role out of respect."

			"A tall and husky Gold Dragonborn, clad in bright colored and decorative clothing, sits on an equally ornate rug. He’s fidgeting with something in his mouth. It’s has a small garnet, chipped by his teeth and covered in spit. He has a small pouch in his vest full of these gross little gems. He sells very beautiful jewelry, thankfully with no bite marks.",

			"This scrawny kobold is making guns. He loves his firearms to death, despite being too small to wield a majority of them. He just loves his craft.",
			"A bald, female wizard doesn’t actually sell anything, but she enchants items for others. She also has a hairless cat, probably related to the same incident. She has looks that could kill, but she is super sensitive when someone brings up her lack of hair.",
			"A young, quiet librarian sits behind a desk reading a book. When the player gets closer, they notice that she’s actually a centaur. She’s quite dainty and gentle for her size.",
			"A disabled dwarf creates small trinkets from bed. His half human daughter takes care of him, but a network of clockwork beasts run his store front, taking care of sales and maintaining each other so they’ll sell for a pretty penny. Rumors about him creating a chair with wheels are spreading, so he’ll finally be mobile again.",
			"An unlikely pair of merchants run an apothecary, alternatingly with one working on baubles while the other deals with customers. The dwarf is a grumpy old man, nearly unapproachable, and usually berates his half-orc apprentice even when in front of the customers. When asked, he typically overprices and generally shuts down any attempts at haggling. The half-orc apprentice is suspicious and intimidating in appearance, and sound threatening when replying to his dwarf master, but is actually much more cordial to the customers and is more lenient when haggling. Both, however, like their beer.",
			"A gnome tinker who has all kinds of different scrounged and jury-rigged magic items. He appears on his cart every couple hours until the party buys something.",
			"An aarakocra resembling a vulture who sells things he finds. By ‘finds’, he means he takes stuff off of dead bodies and whatever else he sees lying around. He’ll sell random pieces of armor, weapons, books, and food he cooks himself with scavenged meats and the like. He’s a great cook and a cynical old coot. His coyote & pepper stew is quite popular.",

			"A scarred, brutish orc selling finely crafted jewelry. if engaged in conversation, he reveals that he only took up the barbaric ways of his people because of peer pressure. Eventually he went adventuring and then decided to pursue his lifelong hobby of crafting rings and necklaces and the like. His clan must believe he is long dead by now.",
			"A young human wizard, yet to lose his baby fat and with no sign of facial hair can provide advanced spell scrolls, but always refers to customers as ‘youngster’ or ‘whippersnapper’. When asked about it, he becomes very upset, muttering about curses and kids not respecting their elders anymore.",
			"A old human luthier with a grey mustache and coke bottle glasses. He’s always working on something and refuses to look away from what he’s working on for more than a second. His teenaged son does most of the dealing, however he spend most of his time playing with the merchandise. The son will keep playing when spoken to and will inform everyone that his band is playing at the tavern that night. Before making any deal he will walk over and ask his father if the deal is fair.",
			"A slender, well-mannered man sells curiosities in a travelling carriage. He has a pet mimic that has taken the form of a small lockbox, which is somehow very well trained and obedient.",
			"A female high elf with shoulder length auburn hair and named Mary Jane sells herbs, fruits and vegetables from a large wagon pulled by a pair of mechanical oxen. Many of the herbs are seasoning; some have medicinal uses and a few have ‘recreational uses’.

			"A quick tongued elven female who has a reputation of being a snob. She often wears a colorful dress that’s skirt reaches down to her knees, several different pieces of jewelry, and a small leather bag that has the symbol of her merchant clan on it.",
			"A halfling peddler who roams town to town selling wears from his ‘many adventures’. If the party sells him something, say a blanket, they might find it for sale in the next town over. The blanket will have some story such as how hiding below it prevents ghosts and goblins from seeing you, or maybe it had kept him warm in the snow capped mountains and was the warmest blanket ever. He will be selling for three times what he paid for it at the least. If you want to add another layer of mystery. The things he says the objects can do actually happen. Aside from the obvious abilities the goods have, they are clearly the same goods the adventures and townsfolk sell him. Down to a wierd stain or carved initial. He is smart enough not to sell goods in the places he bought them.",
			"A smith, a ’90s waif who only weighs 90 pounds if she’s carrying hammer and tongs. She’s tiny, the size of a human ten-year-old. She makes big, heavy things such as plate armor, tower shields, pole arms. They’re of masterwork quality. She’s not deceptively strong, either: she can barely raise the hammer above her shoulder. There’s no enchantment or anything else involved; nobody has ever been able to figure out how she does it.",
			"A kobold sells ‘Enhanced’ potions at a discount from a dingy shop sandwiched between two larger, more reputable stores. The proprietor is somewhat vague on exactly how the potions have been enhanced. They do exactly what the label implies, though (‘Ideally,’ the proprietor insists,) they frequently come with an additional effect. This ‘Enhancement’ can range from enhancing the user’s physical and mental faculties, to making the user’s skin turn blue for hours, to making the user’s tongue taste like bathwater. A particularly intelligent user may be able to determine the side-effect before using it. The rest simply have to hold their breath, drink, and pray.",
			"A tall lanky shop owner who can’t seem to get warm. He wears several sets of clothes at once.",
			"A very grumpy half-orc who gives customers what they want, but does not take requests. His prices are excellent, but he will only sell one item of his own choosing to each PC.",
			"A toothless, vegetarian lizardfolk who sells poultices and other herbal remedies. He claims that he was cursed to have no teeth and took up a different diet out of necessity, and he grinds up his food into a puree so he can eat it properly. His scales are a sickly yellow and he’s almost always bent over his table, grinding up and boiling down various common and exotic plants, all of which he grows or buys himself.",
			"A bizarrely dressed human with a strange beard and haircut. He brews coffee and spends hours perfecting it so he could find the purest, most flavorful blend. In reality, it’s just normal coffee. When being told this, he responds by saying that they aren’t cultured enough to understand the depth of the flavor. He’s incredibly cranky and pretentious for his age, so almost nobody likes him.",
			"A dust genasi who sells a huge variety of cleaning supplies. Brooms, mops, soaps, various scented oils, you name it. He’s constantly leaving a trail of dust around and cleans it up as it gets made. When it’s pointed out that he’s doing a fruitless task, he becomes extremely sarcastic and thanks them for pointing out the obvious. Other than that, he’s pretty laid back.",
			"A Warforged merchant that sells scrap metal, logs, wagons and parts to assemble your own Warforged bodyguard. Oh, and he has some healing potions at discounted prices because ‘What would anyone use them for?’",
			"This unidentifiable person is clad in a bright blue robe and an opaline mask. Their hands and feet are bright blue as well. They sit on a pretty standard rug, cross legged and swaying side to side. His rug is NOT for sale, because he always mentions it before talking to a customer, along with a large tag that says ‘NOT FOR SALE’ on the side. He sells various items, all with some sort of minor magical effect. He doesn’t say much except for strange things like, ‘What’s your favorite color? Mine’s blue.’ and ‘I like your haircut.’ When the party leaves, he quietly hums to himself and disappears as soon as he’s out of earshot. Nobody knows who or what you’re talking about when you try to mention him.",
			"A strangely happy man in a cart pulled by horses. He smiles extremely wide and creepily. He’ll offer free items to the party, like food, if they come into his cart and grab it. You probably should’ve noticed this was a highly advanced mimic, due to his mouth not moving when he talks and the walls of his carriage looking kinda fleshy.",
			"A quiet woman lies lazily on the back of a smooth-shelled ankylosaurus. The anky’s name is Bailey, and she’s just a big puppy dog who likes being pet. The merchant (named Rachael) sells books, and buys books. She also gladly accepts food for her anky. Bailey likes corn a lot.",
			"A triton fisherman riding the back of a colossal catfish, with a small tent on its back. He has wide variety of fish stored in small barrels in preserving salts. He and his catfish have been friends since they were both born, and he takes great offense when someone insults his fish (both the ones he’s selling and the one he’s riding).",
			"A butcher who enjoys his job a little too much. He’s super creepy, but he hasn’t done anything wrong and he is well respected by those who’ve known him for a while.",
			"A huge man wearing sunglasses made of red quartz claims to be the best sculptor in the world. He can prove it too, all his statues are carved from the exact same type of granite and look scarily like the real thing. They always look scared for some reason too. As it turns out, he has a gorgon held hostage in his basement, and he uses her to freeze various animals and people he captures. From raccoons and chickens to cows and people, he’s kidnapping them and petrifying them. Somebody should stop him. He sells his statues for a whole lot of money.",
			"Subtle slave trader. The ‘products’ are actually transformed into animals or trinkets. Upon purchase, the trader will give the new owner a scroll or item to transform the trinket into the slave (maybe even back again). A clever way to smuggle slaves through check points and/or through lands that don’t support slavery.",
			"A cowpuncher with a heavy accent. She sells common livestock, along with a few exotic things like special built saddles and animal barding. She claims to be from a place called ‘Wyoming’, which everyone knows doesn’t exist. She’s completely sane however.",
			"A bearded chef who’s incredibly skinny despite the fact he’s always eating. He’s a very prestigious chef who’s famous for his dragon egg, orange, and tomato omelet. He has a pouch of granola clusters on him that he’s constantly munching on. He jokes about being cursed by a witch when he was younger, but he’s actually correct.",
			"You stumble upon a giant clam shell placed near a road by the beach. Knocking on it, a sleepy man opens the lid and rubs his eyes, asking who’s there. He’ll sell you things he finds in and around the ocean before closing the clam and going back to sleep.",

			"An older human male approximately 60 years old, hulking frame, thick biceps, bald as a bowling ball and wears a gold chain running from earring to nose-ring, nicknamed ‘Bull’ runs a shop with his wife, a delicate grey-haired human woman of medium height, but thin as a rail and speaking with a raspy voice which tells of her advanced age. In this shop, you can find the finest china service sets and tableware in the province. From platters to plates, from pitchers to spoons, from cups to cutlery, everything you need to put out the best spread is available at Bull’s China Shop.",
			"A figure, roughly 5’5”, covered in heavy winter clothing. His(?) voice can be understood, but is muffled by layers of scarves. In actuality, there is nothing underneath the clothing; he’s a modified enchanted armor. They sell a huge variety of armor.",
			"A half-elf wizard with a crow on his shoulder. The wizard turns his head rapidly and jerkily to look at anything that moves, but stays silent. If a customer approaches, the crow speaks to them, disgruntled by the change of bodies between him and his familiar. They sells wants and books, typical wizarding gear.",
			"A vampire couple. They don’t feed off humans, instead coming out at night to hunt elk, rabbits, and other game so they can feed. They say it tastes like stale water mixed with iron shavings and beef broth, but they also say the bad taste is more than worth it so they stay in good standings with the mortals they live near. They sell timber as well as high quality furniture they make themselves. They’ll sell other things like knives, small whittled figures, and furniture polish, if you ask. The community loves them for being so helpful and not causing any problems.",
			"A dwarf with insane eyes, charred hair, and a lack of eyebrows. He has an insane look in his eyes, and is attempting to sell gunpowder and explosives to all who walk by. He keeps sizing up the local buildings with his eyes, especially the wooden ones.",
			"A very articulate bald man with glasses. He has an obscene amount of knowledge on the most useless things, like music and technology. He’s a comedian with a small food business on the side. He has a short and sweet wife who makes the delicious food that he sells. They have two long hair cats, who they call their sons. They use strange words and phrases that nobody else understands, like ‘acquiesce’ and ‘get dusted’.",
			"Armiton, very calm minded human who sells the crops he grows on his farm. His workers are all homunculi.",
			"A stout burly man with a slightly singed brown beard and tanned, scarred complexion; he’s wearing a faded motley cloak and sells a variety of odds and ends. When discussing his goods, he shows off the mundane objects at his stall as if they were exotic wonders. The magical items however, are dismissed as ‘silly pish-posh’ and he hardly acknowledges them.",
			"A half-elf, half-dryad who’s mother was a willow. He has long, flowing hair with flowers scattered in it. His dryad nature shows through, as patches of his skin are textured like wood and his hair is a light green, among other things. He is always sitting down, whether it’s crisscross on the floor or on a nearby branch. Around his neck is a small heart made of amber with a tiny blue flower embedded inside. He’ll sell you various traveling provisions and other useful, mundane things, like shovels and lanterns.",
			"A short haired woman with a light voice. She plays the ukulele and sings as a street performer. She’ll play any song on request, for a price. She seems to know every song imaginable by heart even when she has no possible way of knowing it, and she never falters in her performance. She NEVER lets her prized ukulele out of sight.

			"A young Goblin merchant that is constantly trying to sell the random scraps and knickknacks he finds lying around from the massive burlap sack on his back. Many of his goods tend to be in poor condition or are junk, and a good amount of them were found through more liberal interpretations of the phrase “lying around”. Despite this, he is a hard worker that is just trying to make a living in any way he can manage, and genuinely appreciates anyone who acknowledges that. Those who do usually end up with better deals on more junk, as well as the opportunity to purchase first when he truly finds something of value. Every time someone browses his wares, he proudly proclaims that he’s got the best deals anywhere, despite his tendency to slightly overprice all his goods.",
			"A middle-aged Human blacksmith hawks his weapons and armor from the side of a small indoor arena that he owns. The portly man is eager to draw in customers, and is very proud of his works, inviting people in from off the streets to admire their impressive appearances. He is always eager to sell his normal merchandise, but those who wish to purchase his most ornate works must prove that they are capable of handling themselves in combat against a battered set of animated armor, and are challenged to push the construct out of the 15-foot radius arena without getting knocked prone by it. Only if you can do it will he allow a customer to purchase his masterpieces, all of which are beautifully yet practically designed, made from exotic materials that are perfect for enchanting.",
			"A tottering old Halfling woman often found heavily bundled up on the corners of busy streets. Despite being nearly blind, she sews repairs to cloaks and clothing in exchange for stories and tales. She is incredibly good-hearted and refers to everyone she meets as “Dearie”. She insists that she doesn’t need money and that the stories she hears make her the wealthiest woman alive, but her customers always tend to leave her some coin anyway. The repairs she makes seem patchwork and haphazard, but are surprisingly durable in addition to making the fabric much more homey and comfortable.

			"A small iron golem smith, who exclusively crafts razor sharp longswords (crit range 18-20, cost 200 gp, otherwise same as normal longswords). His hammer is actually an intelligent magic item that gives instructions to him in a way the players can’t perceive. The golem always talks about the hammer, not himself (‘he has this for sale, he would charge you that, etc.’) Upon receiving payment the golem throws the gold in a pot in the forge and later, if the party pays attention, mixes bronze into it after hours to produce gold bars, if it doesn’t know the party is watching.",
			"A blue-skinned tiefling who works as a glassblower. He has a lot of beautiful pots, jars, and bottles, all of which are made in stunning colors and dazzling designs. Aside from these, he also has glass weapons and armor. They’re really clunk, but they’re as powerful as they are beautiful.

			"A halfling man who runs the printing business in town. His printing press is unlike any you’ve ever seen, about the size of a carriage and constantly clicking and whirring quietly as it prints like clockwork, and where he got it is a mystery.

Purchases are made by putting the coins into a slot build into his desk, then the enchantment will wear off, allowing you to take your clothes.",
			"A well dressed woman with a veil over her face pulls you into an alley before commanding you to buy something. A shelf of potions accompanies her, all unmarked.

			"A tabaxi with shaggy fur sells livestock, who are all acting strange and annoyed. She swears they aren’t stolen. Stop asking.",
			"A royal guard with a scrawny body and weak chin. He’ll give you the latest gossip on the town for a few coins. He’ll tell you regardless, then get annoyed when you don’t pay.",
			"An aarakocra chicken who sells healing potions. The potions are contained in eggshells and look like normal eggs, if a bit larger than the usual. The merchant will fluff up and squawk indignantly if a PC wonders whether the merchant laid the eggs. She will scratch in the dirt and wave a feathered arm angrily. ‘NOT my—bawk!—CHILDREN.’ The potions all heal an extra 2 HP, but the shells are fragile.",
			"Legitimate Larry. He’s so legitimate that his collection of obviously stole items obviously must have just fallen off the back of a cart.",
			"A Halfling Artificer and Tinker, with a broad smile and gregarious nature. He produces intricate, ingenious mechanical devices for adventurers. The shop he operates out of is built-to-halfling-scale, though. To broaden his customer base, he has fitted every shelf, display, and even the front wall of the building with a complex system of rails and slides, allowing him to do business with anyone, and display anything, all at the customer’s eye level.",
			"What appears to be an EXTREMELY tall halfling woman, but when she walks around the counter, she is simply wearing the tallest pair of platform shoes you’ve ever seen. All she sells is shoes. Some of the shoes are enchanted, but many are just ‘fashionable’.",
			"A tortle that, when it approaches, it appears the shell has been carved to look like tattoos. When he speaks, he has a deep slow tone to his voice (imagine Johnny Cash). He sells books and scrolls and writing equipment. He is never in a rush to make a sale as he enjoys the act of bartering but always ensures he makes a profit. His stock often holds rare or even forbidden books. When asked, he will just shrug and say something about not knowing or forgetting the book was there. He of course houses lots of spell scrolls at different levels and will even sell a few spellbooks from wizards that gave either passed or given up that life.",
			"Bobbik and Bimbeck’s Curiosities: Mr. Bobbik is a bespectacled Beholder with a friendly and inquisitive nature. A true oddity in his species and as such shunned entirely from polite underdark society. In his travels, he met Mr. Bimbeck, who was exploring caverns looking for interesting rocks and a lifelong friendship was formed. The two of them sell all manner of strange and unique things. They probably don’t have EXACTLY what you are looking for, but they certainly have something of interest. Example Inventory: A potted plant with a bell on it (So it can’t sneak up on you), a warhammer that you can fill with angry bees, Aardvark poison, Aardvark medicine, a clockwork thing you don’t know what it does that has a bell on it so it can’t sneak up on you.",
			"Sister Elma: She claims to be a Nun and sells holy symbols and dubious reliquaries to travelers. Example Inventory: Martyr’s Big Toe on a string, desicrated left testicle of a legendary bard, mostly accurate holy symbols at discount prices, bag of bones from a legendary warrior (or a chicken, depending on perception checks).",
			"Bob and Rob Oblah (And Hobble their Goblin assistant): An Ettin with 4 eyes for values! Not the brightest, but with a natural sense for what things are worth and if they are being cheated or short-changed. The two heads can be played off of each other in the process of haggling. Hobble the Goblin mostly just stares daggers at the customer and polishes the counter. Example Inventory: Magic Items, hand made Goblin crafts.",
			"A new gnomish invention that automatically dispenses a piece of gum that works as a healing potion if the proper amount of gold is inserted. Roll a d20 when using the machine. On a 20, two pieces of gum come out. On a 1 the machine jams and no gum comes out. Has tamper resistance enchantments that destroy the gum if the machine is broken into.",
			"A dwarven barber that uses magical shears. Cuts their client’s hair to be longer, not shorter.",
			"A Tabaxi merchant sells beautiful glassware and fine china, things that an adventurer would probably never use. Symbols on his shop in thieves’ cant suggest he may also be a fence, although they are confusing, crossed out and re-written. The Tabaxi, a dark-coated young merchant named Many Hidden Knives, is boisterous and eager to gossip.",
			"The shopkeeper is clearly two gnomes with one on the other’s shoulders, but they will never admit it. The two, Foggi Ysbeten and Grogel Grogelhome, take turns being the one on top, but never acknowledge the difference. They sell ‘human-sized’ equipment.",
			"The Broad’s Boards: An extremely tall, stunningly attractive blonde woman named Nyss sells shields of different makes and models. Has some magic shields, some bucklers, and some tower shields too big for the average man.",
			"A Goliath, considered large even among his own tall people, known only as ‘The Builder.’ He crafts intricate toys, gadgets, and trinkets. Working from inside a wagon pulled by two Clydesdale horses, he hunches over his desk with a lantern and a magnifying glass, working his massive fingers to build tiny, detailed devices. If he meets a child, he always gives them a toy for free. He never accepts gold as payment, only more materials for crafting, or if the need arises, a personal favor. He can be commissioned to build specific devices, but prefers not to unless he knows the person well. He sticks to rural towns and villages and defends himself with a myriad of clockwork like devices that are beyond most people’s understanding.",
			"Azaeli, A devilish tradesmen. A man of true evil. Holds some of the best gear around and sells them very low as well, but they come at a cost, Azaeli gives the buyer a quest of true evil intentions. Rather it be spreading a plague, or allowing crime syndicates to florish, a seemingly useless action that has large impact on the nearby areas. Azaeli has a pair of seemingly burning eyes, is often found to be wearing a top hat and very expensive silk clothing. In his backstory Azaeli, was once a normal True neutral, human warlock, until one day Azaeli attempted to banish a powerful demon. It succeeded but as soon as he cast it he was possessed causing a merge of souls. Azaeli became a devilish sellsman who roams the globe causing mayhem.",
			"Whilst walking through through the run down boroughs of a large city you spy a strange exchange down one of the numerous labyrinthine alleys. A rather large and motley crow sits upon a busted crate. At the base of the crate an alley cat, accompanied by a scraggly litter of kittens, approaches the crow and drops what looks to be a shiny piece rubbish. You look on as both the cat and the crow seem to converse, the low cawing of the crow meeting the desperate meows of the cat. Eventually some sort of accord seems to be struck, and the crow produces a large half eaten fish, dragging it from the crate and letting it plop down on the dirty ground bellow. Immediately the mother alley cat picks up the fish and darts off, her kittens tumbling along behind her. Those who wish to stay and observe the crow for longer will discover that all manner of strays, ferals and other wild denizens of the alleys approach the crow throughout the day, including one or two beggars and street kids. Each time something shiny is produced, and an item from the box given. Sometimes food, sometimes junk, and at one point even a dagger (given to a street kid) is pulled from the crate. At sundown several more crows gather at the spot in the alley and begin to fuss around the crate. Eventually they all take flight, labouring under a sack clearly laden with goods. They cary the sack high above the roof tops, eventually disappearing from sight, their mysterious trade having officially closed for the day.",
			"A series of animals who seem to run every magic shop the party goes’s to. They’re capable of communicating via telepathy, but mostly prefer to make animal noises. Probably the familiars of some old mage.",
			"A very short wizened old man with a wispy mustache. He runs a pet shop and seems to always be talking to himself. When someone enters his shop he will grab them by the elbow and begin walking them around to all the cages and kennels and tanks. No matter what they say, he’ll respond with things like ‘Yes, he is a bit tall, isn’t he?’ or ‘Now don’t be rude, he doesn’t smell that bad.’ or ‘Ah yes, I remember. You don’t want a single pet, you want to adopt a whole family.’ Finally he gets to one animal and says ‘Eh? This one looks good to you? Excellent!’ He then picks them up out of the cage, hands them to the person – again, regardless of whatever the person is saying – and then says ‘Now there is just the little matter of payment …’. Which is when the animal bites or claws the person and then gives the store owner a single drop of blood. Because he doesn’t sell pets to people, he sells people to pets."

The host is terminally ill/cursed/bored of this whole ‘living’ thing and their life insurance doesn’t cover natural death/insert other option here, but wants to go out with STYLE, and essentially writes the party into the will/policy/etc. if they stage a murder-mystery. Alternatively, the contractor is a murder mystery novel writer looking for a publicity stunt or something. Feel free to have either go sideways.",
			"Last week, a local wizard’s apprentice turned him/herself into the local jail after confessing to killing their master in a laboratory accident. Investigators did a cursory inspection and found evidence of the accident, but no body. The supposedly dead wizard turns up alive within the week, claims a miraculous escape to another plane that took a week to return from, but refuses any sort of investigation.

The mind flayers’ high priest and the highest-ranked drow diplomat in their city were murdered. A war with the drow will likely break out unless the perpetrator is brought to justice.

The brain came to the conclusion surface dwellers were needed to sort the mess out. Solve the case or have your brains eaten.",

			"A group of elderly men, who are or were very prominent in the town (councilors, wealthy merchants, guild leaders etc.) start dying, one by one. At first it seems to be accidents, but soon it escalates to blatant murder. One of the numbers had died of natural causes sometime before, and his body was exhumed, mutilated, and his skull left in the house of one of the others. After the third death, two and two was put together and rumors begin to flow – this is exactly the group of men that were accused of the gang rape of a beautiful young teen girl, many years ago. They are now closing ranks again and have been seen visiting each other’s houses to confer. At the time, the power of these men led to the girl’s family abandoning her and accusing her of lying.

His son has ascended to his position, and despite the young man’s previous know-nothing attitude, he’s proven to be oddly adept at managing local affairs. Many have said he takes after his father to an uncanny degree.",
			"The party comes to a new town and stays the night at an inn. Everything seems normal, but when they go downstairs the next morning, they find the innkeeper and all the patrons from the previous night have been brutally slain. (Optional: the rest of the town has absolutely no reaction to this.)",

The crew has a heated disagreement at the port tavern for some reason (between them, or with a local or the captain finds his daughter with one of them). The captain spends the night prior to the departure at a private lodging, after some business. In the morning of the departure, the captain is nowhere to be seen on the ship, the already stowed away item is missing, and a boy is screaming bloody murder on a back alley.

A scholar at the nearby museum dies during the night as if he was being chased by some weird monster (pixies, orc, you choose). A new painting has been delivered the week prior and might shed some answers to the death. The inducer created a night at the museum scenario and some paintings from a specific wizardly artist gained life and roamed during the night. The scholar wasn’t particularly amicable but had great knowledge and might have had relevant information for the party.",
			"The PCs are asked to investigate a local mining company that is producing over three, sometimes four, times the usual amount of processed ores than expected, with the miners having no memories of working their shifts in the newest, deepest shaft.

			"A Cranium Rat approaches the party and asks for their help. Someone in town has been killing Cranium Rats to the exclusion of killing other forms of rodent pests and somehow, the psychic connection between the Cranium Rats breaks before death, denying the Hive from knowing their killer.",
			"An apprentice to the community’s wizard is in jail for killing his master. It seems a Clay Golem they were building tore the head off the wizard and then ran into the woods. The only people who could have given orders to the Golem were the wizard and his apprentice so it’s obvious the apprentice did it, yet he claims he is innocent.",
			"Two powerful wizards have been feuding for years, but until today it was always fairly civil: written letters, disputations published in scholarly circles, and the occasional annoying and irritating curse (May your nose hair grow ten feet!). Today one of the wizards was found dead in his/her lab with the other wizard’s dagger in his/her back.",
			"The Local Lord’s poison taster fell grievously ill during a dinner party and everyone panicked. The Chef and all of her staff were arrested on grounds of attempted murder, the Alchemist was seen in the kitchens and so he too was arrested, and the King’s cup bearer is under suspicion as well. On top of it all, the neighboring Lord is riding about the border ‘hunting bandits’ and sending patrols into the local county…",
			"A serial killer is loose on town! The fourth body has been discovered and all share a shocking trait: each one is a dwarf, recently come to town to work the nearby mines. Is someone targeting dwarves or is there another link between them? And why now?",
			"A prominent businessman in the timber industry goes missing. His body can be found with a tree growing from his chest in the forest.",
			"A righteous, or perhaps not so righteous warband/military unit, was completely slaughtered overnight in their fort. There are signs of a massive battle, but all the carnage is within the walls.",
			"First it was random children of peasants that had gone missing. When the city watch began investigating, the children of watchmen started disappearing! Can the PCs, who have been selected because they have no family, determine the cause of the child abductions? Without endangering any other children?",
			"The entirety of a town gets invited to the noble‘s annual dinner party at his colossal mansion. Shortly after all the guests have arrived the noble has seemed to have disappeared, but his body was found later with a dagger in his back. Then the lower-class guests start disappearing and dying in various different ways. The killings seem to be gradually going up the social ladder.",

			"A man is found dead in his home, his body completely drained of blood. All 1.5 gallons of his blood have been neatly stored in glass jars around the corpse.",
			"Corpses have been showing up near the town. They all have the odd quirk of the victims seemingly asleep, if it weren’t for the total lack of all organs and the corpses randomly being cut into pieces with near surgical precision. Also, the town’s medics are all clerics, with nobody having the sort of precision tools or skills to cut super finely through bone.",
			"The party receives a letter from a noble, calling them forth to his court. Soon, he reveals that a threat of murder is afoot. A devil walks among them, and the party must route them out.",
			"A family moved away from the village further into unsettled territory. It has been almost a month since anyone has heard from them, and it appears that after some madness and violent ends, the surviving family fled to a lighthouse owned by a relative.",
			"Tasked to retrieve an item from an old castle and village, the party, contractor, and an extra crew make their way there to loot the location. However, as storm sets in and a crew member is found dead, something foul is afoot.",
			"Seemingly out of nowhere, a screaming body comes plummeting towards the ground. It appears to have maybe been aimed at someone…",
			"A few days after the party where the local woodworker was drunkenly bragging to a PC about how he has a shipment of rare wood used for detailing and instruments, he was found dead, murdered with his own wood axe.",
			"The party arrives at a port city and finds tensions running high. The local nobility, guild masters, working class and underworld are in a four-way standoff over expected payments, quality of products and working conditions: negotiations were already tense and then the first body showed up. So far, the victims have been the children of working-class leaders, but now the daughter of a prominent and universally respected guild master (thought to be the best chance at a peaceful resolution) has vanished. The cities ruling family has been silent on the matter, mercenaries are pouring into the city and maritime trade has dropped sharply…",
			"The party wakes up in the crypts of a large town or city, with no recollection of their deaths and each carrying an invitation to a formal event, dated two days ago. Investigating the event’s location reveals that it is currently locked up by the city guard to investigate a mass killing, the victims being the party members themselves!",

Only these killings take place on a New Moon, while Mr. Lazuli transforms on a full moon …",
			"The city has a serial killer on its hands! Maybe? There’s a new death every few weeks, but always killed in a new way, cut, shot, impaled, tortured. The strange thing is the victims look identical, not like anyone the police recognize. But the bodies are all the same man. Dying with a grin on his face …",
			"A lich wants you to solve his own murder. He insists on coming along with you to play “good cop, bad cop”.",
			"A mysterious man in red has been killing violent criminals and corrupt officials throughout the city. The mayor was positively gleeful at first, but ever since his cousin’s ties to a crime ring have been made public, he’s been pressing the guards and bounty hunters to find and capture the man in red under the mantra; “Vengeance is not justice!”.",
			"The man in red, a vigilante who’s been killing violent criminals and corrupt politicians in the city, has been found dead. The city guard aren’t touching this case because the man in red had powerful enemies, and it looks like one of them had him killed.",
			"A person explodes in a gout of fire. Then 2 more nearby. A creature is possessing these victims before they ignite. Then the creature turns on the players! It could be that the victims (or at least one of them) are connected somehow. Are there more victims throughout the city? It’s clear that the heroes must find this out before it happens again! Chasing the clues might reveal that the creature was summoned and specifically targeted (at least one of) the victims! What do the players do when they find out that original summoner is attacked? Did the victim(s) deserve it? Is the threat resolved? Does the creature make another attack?",
			"Household ‘Otto-Servant’ warforged automatons have recently become a trend among the well to do. The inventor sends a message to the players asking for help using an unassuming middleman as cutout. It seems the inventor fears for their life. Then the inventor is attacked by one their inventions! Rumors of the devices spread like wildfire, and copycat attacks seem to be happening! Can the players protect the life of the inventor, and prove that the automaton WASNT the source of the attack? Has the inventor died by the clamps of their own creation? Perhaps there is a competing product being used to ruin the inventor’s reputation! Maybe the inventor stole the idea, and the original creator is getting revenge?",

			"A house was destroyed and all inside were killed. Strangely, half of the house exploded outward in an incredible fireball, the embers of which are still too hot to approach. While the other half was encased in a sheet of ice so cold that touching it with a body part requires the skin to be pulled off to let go. If you pass a high arcana check you realize that the murder was most likely caused by someone using the demon Maxwell.",

			"Witnesses say the victim was struck by lightning, while inside a building.",
			"Body found in an alley behind a well-known tavern that is frequented by high societal patrons who don’t want to know or seen visiting with specific types of people. (Thieves, murderers for hire, drug dealers. Dealers of other material that is not quite common to keep around.)",
			"A body apparently exploded into large chunks, a significant amount of mess on the floor but no blood on the walls. (Flesh to stone, topple the statue, dispel).",
			"In the city’s main temple, a well-known noble is found dead in the inner sanctum. It is known there is only one way in or out, and it is by being accompanied by a member of the temple’s high court. Upon investigation, the cause of death appears to hanging (broken neck and rope burn around the neck) but there is no rope to be found and nowhere in the sanctum to be hung from. (Rope Trick).",
			"A roughly circular area in the slums of the city contains an emaciated corpse, several dead rats, and a good number of dead insects. (Circle of Death).",
			"A body that clearly feel from the sky in the middle of town with no trees or real buildings around.",
			"An archeological dig at an ancient tomb has been going on for weeks. But the crew are no fools. They’ve brought in experts and priests to avoid traps and curses the place has on it, as well as hiring the party to take out any other threats that lurk in the depths. It’s good pay for several days of killing bulettes, cloakers, umber hulks, and the occasional mummy that may arise, etc. There are protests by the locals of disturbing a sacred site, vocal but nothing violent. The head archeologists are very secretive however, and seem to be searching for something specific, dismissive of other treasures. Then, one night, the main team is found dead in their study area, lungs filled with sand, clutching at their latest notes.",
			"The dock-master has gone missing for several days, and the harbor is in disarray, wondering where he went. That is, until a group of children find his body tied up and beaten to death in their secret cove hideout that they thought only they knew about. The bruises look like they were made by a fist wearing rings on each finger. In the dock-master’s inside coat pocket is a letter blackmailing him with instructions to find and come to this cove.",
			"A hermit witch is both feared and revered by the locals for her seemingly dark powers but also the magical potions and tonics she sells to the village to fix various mundane problems like hair loss or love interests. Last night, a horrible, blood-curdling scream was heard throughout the entire village, coming from the remote hut. Upon investigation, the witch is nowhere to be found, except with a message scrawled on blood on the floor: ‘THE BLASPHEMOUS AND HER FLOCK SHALL BE PUNISHED’. The villagers are begging you to find the culprit and save them from whatever is coming.",
			"A collection of incredibly realistic sculptures are found in the courtyard of a local noble’s home, delivered with a single letter signed ‘W’. Each statue depicts a different member of his family in the exact garbs they were wearing the night before, when they had coincidentally been at a dinner party. They had returned much later than expected…",

		"rows": [
			"Arachnus Phylarkus. This delicate mushroom looks like a small black bowl with thin brown gills about 10cm across. It is poisonous to simply ingest but when steeped in boiling water for 10 minutes a thin black tea is created. This tea when consumed grants the drinker resist poison and disease for 4 hours. The mushroom is often the home of a particularly venomous type of spider and is difficult to harvest.",
			"Terra Mirabilis Bo`letus. When ingested, this mushroom produces an effect similar to a Reduce Person or Enlarge Person spell. The effect is limited to three rounds. The effect produced is determined by where one bites the mushroom. That is to say, one side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter. The difficulty is determining which side is which, or even where a ‘side’ begins and ends on a perfectly round object. Eating the entire mushroom will produce either effect randomly for 1d10 rounds.",
			"Fyngum Stinkus. This small aquamarine colored mushroom emits a foul smell when crushed. It can be used to overwhelm the senses, cover your scent, prank your friends, or can be distilled into a throw-able stink bomb. (Note, is also known to be a powerful goblin attractant)",
			"Amanita muscaria S. M. A button mushroom, whose top is red with white spots. The stem is mostly yellow except for two parallel black bars. If it is eaten it produces an effect similar to the enlarge spell, along with immunity to concussions. The effect ends whenever damage is taken.",
			"Seductus Lactimus “Lust-shroom”. A golden luminescent mushroom with silver spots. Ingesting the mushroom makes the creature who ate it hallucinate, making anything they see appear as a mushroom. Additionally, the creature has an unusually intense desire to consume all other mushrooms in sight which puts them into an uncontrollable rage.",
			"Profundus Obscurus ‘The Deceiver’. This average brown and purplish mushroom ranges in size, features, and color. No two alchemists can agree on exactly how to classify it, or if they are even discussing the same mushroom. Implicated in untold arguments and altercations throughout history, it wasn’t until the Great Debate of the Late Dyvonian Council nearly ended in bloodshed, that David Orelchy pointed out the mushroom exhibited the same energies as the spell ‘Confusion’. When contained in a glass bottle the spores are contained and it can be thrown as a ranged weapon. The affect is 2 d12 wide and lasts for 4 turns unless there is a stiff wind.",
			"Enchantrynium Blistarix Wizard’s Bane mushroom. This large, blue, tall-stalked mushroom gives its consumer a resistance to magical damage for 1 hour, but the consumer must make a DC 15 constitution save after that hour or take 1d4 poison damage. Particularly large specimens can be shared by an entire party.",
			"Betrothitus Indusiatus, aka ‘Bride’s Veil’. A thin, ghostly white mushroom with a thin, veil-like skirt billowing from under its cap. Bride’s Veils become almost completely transparent in moonlight and grow at the edges of thick forests. The skirts, though extremely fragile, can be woven together into fabric using a precise hand (though very few have been known to possess the talent) for qualities similar to a cloak of invisibility. When brewed into a tea or liquid, the consumer experiences the effects of Invisibility for 1d4 hours.",
			"Pleurotus Androgenomyces. A small, dark blue mushroom that grows in clusters of three. It particularly prefers soil that has been soaked in fermented beverages like beer, ale, mead etc… Commonly seen outside of pubs in warmer climates. When consumed fresh it transforms the imbiber into the opposite gender for 1d4 hours and increases Charisma by 1d6 for the entire duration of effect. For this quality it is colloquially known as the ‘False Whores Cap’ due to the tendency of poor drunkards to impulsively eat them in order to sell their newfound bodies to bar patrons in order to afford more alcohol.",
			"Visus Invisibilia. A small, rare, clear transparent mushroom with a milky substance seen throughout the bowl. It grants the person that eats the fungus the ability to see invisible creatures/objects for 4 hours. Upon consumption the PC must do a DC 12 Constitution save or they cannot tell the difference between hallucinations that the fungus can cause.",
			"Tricholgossum Falfortinem and Trichoglossum Fortinem. Two outwardly identical small fungi that resemble miniature black cats tongues. The T. Fortinem will give those who consume it whole a berserker rage, for 10 minus Con. modifier rounds. After the rage fades, those that consume must make a Con 10 save or gain 1 rank of exhaustion. The T. Falfortinem will give those that consume it a euphoria and a feeling of invincibility. Con 15 save on success, grants resistance to bludgeoning and piercing for 10 minus Con. modifier rounds. On fail those that take it gain a -1 penalty to STR and Con until long rest.",
			"Bufos Draconii or ‘The Dragon Toad’. A species of 10 different mushrooms of similar shape with scale-like armored caps. Each mushroom is a distinct color and matches the variety of colors that dragon species are known by. Including one for each metallic and each chromatic dragons. Consuming the stem of this mushroom gives you a one-time use of a lesser version of that colored dragon’s breath weapon, 4d4 in cone or line depending. Once consumed this mushroom will fatigue the consumer and they will begin to hallucinate for 4d4 rounds. These hallucinations often involve being attacked by a large dragon of the same type as the consumed mushroom.",
			"Yarokol Plenenium. A small off-white mushroom with a blue-green glow. This mushroom strangely requires a drop of blood to cultivate. When ingested this fungus tastes almost uncannily of meat. The ingester suffers a disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws made to resist enchantment spells cast by the provider of the drop of blood for 2d4 days while the mushroom passes through their system. The effect may be ended early with a greater restoration spell. In addition, while affected by the mushroom, the provider of the drop of blood may cast enchantment spells on the consumer from any distance, if the provider knows where the consumer is. Drow mages have been known to use these mushrooms in a hearty version of a famous lizard egg stew called Nildax Godeneld.",
			"Nubious Mortificantus or Death Cloud. The stem of this mushroom is a yellow-brown color with a red, purple and green bubble at its top. This enormous mushroom stands at 2-4 feet tall and can grow on trees, rocks or on most ground surfaces. This mushroom has gills but produces spores in a different way. The bubble pod at the top of the stem is about 1 foot wide and when broken or pierced in any way releases a silver-blue cloud of spores that latch onto all surrounding objects. Within 6 hours the spores sprout new fungus that begin to grow and anything they touch. When exposed to spores of this mushroom fall on a living host they will be paralyzed within 6 hours as the mushroom begins to grow. Within 72 hours, without medical assistance, the fungus will spread thin filaments into vital organs and slowly kill its host. Death Cloud patches often obscure bone piles and desiccated husks of their former hosts.",
			"Unguisi Aquilia or Eagles Claw mushroom. This plain brown mushroom is about 6 cm high and can be distinguished by the large white dots on its gills and stem. Found around the base of very tall trees, Unguisi Aquilia does not appear to have any special properties and is often collected by travelers for a quick supper. However, experienced mages and mushroom hunters know that within minutes of consuming this delicious mushroom humanoids grow wings and large talons on their feet, often destroying clothing and armor in the process. Mages or others who are prepared before they consume this mushroom gain the ability to fly for up to 2 hours and also gain a sweeping talon strike that does 2 d6 of piercing damage. Tales of fireballs raining from the sky are often considered signs of dragon activity when in fact this curios little brown mushroom might be to blame.",
			"Psathyrella Aquatica. This mushroom can be found in rivers, lakes, and other waterways. It is small and silvery blue with white spots on its cap. When consumed Psathyrella Aquatica gives the ability to breathe underwater for 1d4 hours. Over consumption in humans can cause the consumer to grow gills behind their ears which damage hearing and affects perception.",
			"Locusti Fungili The Mad Cap mushroom is a small brownish mushroom with a red mark on its cap that is similar to an X. When consumed this mushroom gives its consumer a mental map of its environment within 3d12′ of the spot it was picked.",
			"Magilicus Tempesti or Storm Mushroom is a relatively large turquoise mushroom that can change weather with release of spoors often using this ability to dampen its environment and call forth small storm when in danger. When disturbed the mushroom releases spores in an upward cone that do 1d6 necrotic damage upon exposure. A small magical lightning storm is formed in a 40′ circle around the mushroom for 1d8 rounds and all creatures who fail their saving throws take 1d4 lightning damage per round while under the cloud.",
			"Myconis Lacusti is a large black semi-rectangular fungus that often resembles a block of stone. When disturbed it teleports whatever is touching it into a demi-plane consisting of a small room with mushy walls. This plane will only transport its contents back to the mushroom if it is burned. The contents of the demi-plane take 1d6 damage as they teleport back.",
			"Proturbatis Fraudibus or the Joke Cap is a red mushroom about 2 feet in height with a thick cap. This mushroom was genetically altered by a necromancer long ago to tap into the dead souls of comedic bards. When disturbed the ‘Fun-Guy’ reveals a human mouth and spouts a stream of one-liners in common that either antagonize or fascinate the listener but in either case they gain a bonus 1d6 bonus to perception. If anything touches the mushroom however it releases spores in a 20′ cloud that incite spontaneous laughter incapacitating those exposed for 1d4 rounds.",
			"Boletus Aurumni. This tiny golden mushroom is harmless to touch and delicious to eat raw giving its consumer a 1d6 bonus to constitution for 10 hours. However, certain alchemists know that if collected in bulk and distilled into a think golden syrup, the concoction can be used to turn copper, silver, and other base metals into gold.",
			"Exspiravit Bosletavi. A pale white mushroom that sheds a phantom silver glimmer in darkness. Said to grow where a man with unfinished business died, it’s often found in graveyards and ancient tombs. If properly dried for 24 hours the consumer will be able to cast once speak with the dead. With a failed CON save (CD 10) they will have hallucinations of dead people talking to them. It is said that these hallucinations represent the spirits of the corpses buried under the mushroom even though this is clearly nonsense born from popular superstitions there are rumors of people who found ancient treasures a long time forgotten by following the instructions of this “spirits”. All legends have a seed of truth maybe…",
			"Fortuna Fortinaticus is a rather normal looking small brown mushroom with green gills that grows mainly in small rings or clusters out of dragon droppings. Coveted for their properties people have attempted to cultivate them for thousands of years to no avail. When one mushroom is consumed all dice roll results automatically get +3 for 1 hour (that is +3 to each die) but consumption of more mushrooms does not increase the bonus at all. At the end of the hour the consumer falls into a deep sleep for 2 hours and no amount of magic or physical prodding can wake them from it.",
			"Champinguini Fumenticatus. Known as the Smoke Ball mushroom, this large fungus has a fat purple stem that is capped with round yellow globes of thin fragile membrane. The contents of the globules are a smoky blue mist that twists and twines around itself. Any movement or object that causes a globe to break releases the mist which flashes out into a 10′ cloud as if under pressure. Contact with the mist results in instant paralysis unless a CON saving throw is made. This saving throw must be made each round for 1d10 rounds to see if a PC/NPC/Monster is still paralyzed or re-paralyzed. With a successful DEX roll a skillful adventurer who finds this mushroom can extract the globe into a glass or other throw-able container for future use. If someone who is carrying these globes trips, falls, is pushed, leans on, or breaks the globes in any way they should hope that nobody is standing too near to them.",
			"Celeritis Maximus. Known as Blur Root grows mostly underground and in the Underdark. It is a curious fungus that avoids light and often grows in very dark conditions with just the small cap peeking out of the ground or leaf cover. The cap is small, light green, and sticky but the stem is long and travels underground for several feet. The roots can be harvested with gloves (they do 1d4 necrotic dame on skin contact) and brewed into a strong tea that grants the drinker double movement for 2d6 minutes. Mining dwarfs often encounter the mushroom and keep vials of the tea on them to aid their escape from cave ins or flooding tunnels, but more often they use is to exploit a newly discovered vein of ore as fast as possible before others learn of it. The Drow also use it to kill things faster.",
			"Limus Botelium. This mushroom is small, green, and slimy to the touch and is often called Slimy Doom. Any creature that eats this fungus begins to bleed uncontrollably, has a disadvantage on CON. checks and saving throws, and whenever they take damage they are stunned until the end of its next turn.",
			"Wizard’s Eye. In the caves of the iron coast grows a mushroom many call the Wizard’s Eye. They can be found in the caves by following their reddish glow to the nooks and crannies they propagate in. The mushroom itself is a small round ball that is reddish brown and translucent. Cooked in stew they are tasty and non-reactive but when used in conjunction with a fresh eyeball from any form of humanoid they transform into a useful item called a Wizard’s Eye. Placing the mushroom and the fresh eye in a jar together triggers the mushroom to extrude small filaments into the eye and begin to absorb it. Anyone who eats a tendril can see what the new ‘Wizard’s Eye sees for 1d12 hours. They are often placed near dungeon doors, in trees, and stuck to ceilings with putty. The Thieves Guild has been known to pay 100gp for specimens as they seem to have no shortage of eyes to use them with.",
			"Morbidis Dulce. The Sweet Death mushroom is so deadly anything touching it except glass or crystal is wilted and destroyed. Dropping it on someone from above is very mean.",
			"Dusk Cap. Shared hallucinations.",
			"Pinewood Truffle. Illuminates the dark when under 100 ft. underground.",

			"Night Cap. This squat specimen sports a dark inky-blue cap with white speckles and a creamy white stem. Known for inducing vivid and intricate dreams when consumed and used in mass to produce dark blue dye. Blackish-purple spore print.",
			"Fool’s Night. Nearly similar to the Night Cap, but featuring a ring around the stem, Fool’s Night induces violent nausea for several hours after consumed. Also used in mass to produce dark blue dye. Very light spore print.",
			"Rushroom. Purple and wrinkly, consuming increases movement speed by 10 feet for an hour.",
			"Murdermoss. An orange moss that grows in areas polluted with dark magic. Consuming even a little bit forces a DC 20 con check, causing instant reduction to zero on a failure and poisoning on success.",
			"Fumestool. Looks and smells exactly like a piece of human feces sticking upright out of the ground. Doesn’t harm anyone who eats it, but dude! Seriously!?",
			"Willoshroom. Hundreds of small strands hang down from the mushroom, making it look like a willow tree. It can be made into a poison that both deals 1d4 damage each minute and dulls the senses, causing an afflicted creature to be unable to feel pain.",
			"Cherub’s Stool. It glows dimly when exposed to stars in the night sky (the sun causes it to shrink away). It must be harvested on a new moon for the full effect to take place. When the potion is drunk, the creature becomes a Celestial for the duration of its effects. They can also shed bright light for 30 ft and dim light for 30 ft beyond that as an action. Finally, they heal an extra 1d6 hit points whenever they cast a spell that causes a creature to regain hit points.",
			"Foamcap. A mushroom with a puffy, spongelike appearance. It most often grows where lightning has struck. Brewing it correctly into a potion can give a consumer resistance or immunity to Thunder damage, while failing the process can deafen the drinker for 1d10 days.",
			"Amanita Marioscaria. A red toadstool with white spots which is the active ingredient in enlarge potions.",
			"Gripa. Sometimes known as the sign of tragedy, or the plant of deaths. Rumor has it gripa grows where tragedies have taken place, as a memory of the fallen and their miseries. This purple vine grows as a product of the decomposition of a humanoid. It is often used by hags, which makes them really prone to build settlements around areas rich in gripa. It is rare to find, and with a large enough amount, it can be used as a daily treatment to reduce aging and it’s symptoms. It can also be used for purple coloring.",
			"Fishfin Mushrooms. Fluted and reminiscent of a fish’s fins, these mushrooms are found on the underside of fallen tree trunks and have the unusual benefit of giving those who consume them (properly prepared) webbed fingers for 1d4 hours. Unfortunately, regular consumption of these leads to the change becoming permanent and the webbing growing thicker, making fingers much harder to move.",
			"Greencap Mushrooms. The brilliantly green colored caps of these mushrooms warn off those who might think about eating them, but the bright green color makes a wonderful dye when large quantities of these are boiled! They do have a tendency to stain the fingers of anyone who touches them, though.",
			"Bloomshroom. A small blue mushroom with a frilled cap, it normally grows in clusters and can be easily mistaken for flowers by those with vision problems or distinct lack of plant knowledge. Unlike flowers, however, the scent of these mushrooms causes those that inhale it to sneeze uncontrollably for 1d6 minutes.",
			"Davian’s Tree. A man-sized brown capped mushroom that retreats underground during the day and emerges at night, appearing to “deflate” or otherwise shrink as it disappears. It’s flesh is a delicacy, and during summer it releases spores that are said to be able to mask the taste of any good or drink.",
			"Boggleheart. A fungal fruiting body, found buried beneath soft soil. This knotted cluster of sponge-like material exudes an inky black liquid when squeezed, and lesser fey purposefully avoid areas in which they grow. This is because the fungus is extremely toxic to faeries and their ilk, to a deadly degree. The spores that permeate above ground are enough to cause sickness in them and contact with the black liquid can bring death.",
			"Orcus’s Kiss. A pale ridge-type fungus that grows out of dead trees, with red veins running through them. Trees that bear this fungus are slowly granted a new life, revived completely over a period of three months.",
			"Creeping Rott. Sometimes called Devil’s Root. This vine grows in long finger-like tendrils that sprout out of warm locations. These tendrils can be ground into an elixir that once consumed gives a creature advantage on saving throws on spells and other magical effects, as well as saves against poison and disease, but any amount of magical healing they receive also reduces their hit point maximum by half that amount for the potions duration (8 hours).",
			"Gall Flower. A greenish slime mold that blossoms with tiny red spores in the heat of summer. These spores are incredibly toxic and can be refined into a powder which if inhaled can send a creature into toxic shock. An affected creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a success the creature is poisoned for one hour, on a failure the creature is poisoned for this duration but also paralyzed for a number of minutes equal to the number by which they failed the DC by. In contrast, the slime mold itself has great medicinal properties. If applied to wounds over the course of a rest, that creature regains 1d4 additional hit dice as well as 2d4 hit points at the end of that rest.",
			"Imp Stool. A squat mushroom with a bulbous yellow-green head. Consuming it raw has terrible effects of the metabolic system. The creature takes 1d6 poison damage and must make a DC 16 Con saving throw. On a failure this damage also reduces their point maximum by the damage taken until the end of their next long rest. Creatures that fail this save by are also poisoned for a number of hours equal to the number by which they failed this DC. Can be distilled into a more potent elixir that deals 3d6 poison damage on a failure and half on a success with a DC of 11. This elixir can be added to any other ingestible poison with compounding effect and raising the DC by 1.",
			"Curshroom. Looks like a skull with, it grows in contact with blood very fast, even if it’s inside a person, but it’s not deadly, only disfigure the person skin that will grow mushroom, it’s treatable but takes a year, you will look horrible but since it’s a good source of vitamins it’s likely you will never get sick ever again, even once removed.",
			"Plump Helmet. An incredibly sweet mushroom that the dwarves are known to mash and ferment into a unique kind of ‘wine’. Often cooked with syrup made from the indigenous sweet pod fruits, Plump Helmets are incredibly filling, but aside from this, have no unique effects.",
			"Dimple Cup. Another mushroom cultivated by the dwarves, Dimple Cups are inedible. However, when ground up finely, their flesh makes a valuable blue dye for clothing. Eating a Dimple Cup can cause severe food poisoning, dizziness, dehydration and death.",

If prepared properly (crushed into powder then steamed) it will give a +1 to strength checks for 1d4 hours and advantage on con saves/checks for 12 hrs. If consumed without preparation will give advantage on strength checks for 2d6 hours but the consumer will must make a DC 18 con save every half hour or take 2d6 damage every half hour until the effects ware off.",
			"Dwarven Fart. This mushroom is the size of a fist and packed full of spores. Crushing it or throwing it will cause it to release a cloud of spores in an area the size of a 5ft radius sphere. Each creature inside must pass a DC 15 check or be poisoned by an hour.",
			"Brain Fungus. Hear the thoughts of everyone within 60 feet for 3d4x10 minutes. (WARNING, DO NOT CONSUME WITHIN A CITY, LONG AND SHORT TERM MADNESS MAY OCCUR).",

All give elemental resistance for 8 hours after being eaten cooked with meat",

			"Phoenix Shroom. Small mushrooms with a pointed, amber colored cap, these mushrooms often grow in tightly packed groups around the ashes of campfires and glow a distinct yellow and red color in the dark. Phoenix shrooms are often mistaken for fires from a distance. When used to make stew these mushrooms have a natural spice that grate those who drink it fire resistance for the next hour per serving eaten.",
			"Temple Bells. These bronze-colored mushrooms grow in clusters of six. When eaten, they heal 1hp and provide resistance to necrotic damage for 10 minutes.",

			"Leaky Inkwell. The black liquid that oozes from these mushrooms (hence the name) is commonly extracted to be used as ink for spellbooks. Curiously, the ‘ink’ is also edible and has a spicy flavor profile.",
			"Kobold Cap. When ingested, these crimson mushrooms make the consumer hysterical and jumpy as if under the effect of a fear spell.",
			"Tiamat’s Toadstool. These capped mushrooms grow in clusters of 5 with each cap colored to match the chromatic dragons. When ingested, each mushroom grants the consumer resistance to the damage type that corresponds to the color of the caps (red for fire, blue for lightning, green for poison, black for acid, and white for cold). However, eating more than one mushroom within an 8 hour period is harmful to the body and causes 1d8 necrotic damage for each mushroom ingested in that time.",
			"Brawler’s Button. For 4 hours after consuming this bitter mushroom, the consumer’s unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 damage and gains a resistance to bludgeoning damage.",
			"False Reaper. This mushroom causes a humanoid who eats it to make a Con save (DC 13) or become poisoned. If a creature chooses to willingly fail the save by preparing themselves with meditation beforehand they can drop to 0 hit points instead and remain there, suspended in a state of false death nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. This state lasts for 48 hours – whereupon they may make their death saving throws at advantage. If they succeed their saving throws they immediately come awake with half their HP and a level of exhaustion. If they succeed two, they come awake as above but with 2 levels of exhaustion. If they succeed one, they come awake with two levels of exhaustion and 1 HP. If they fail their saves, they stabilize at 0 and remain unconscious until they come awake naturally or are magically healed, coming away from the experience with two levels of exhaustion and a blinding headache."

			"The Tree of Sacrifice – A abnormally large and oddly pale brown tree where the branches are twisted, and the leaves are a sickly saturated green color. At the base of the tree lies a blood stained alter that the roots of the tree have grown around it and now hold it in place. The base of the tree as well as the ground around the alter are permanently stained a deep red. If the tree is cut, a thick blood sap seeps out of wound. If a creature is sacrificed on the alter, the blood pools near where the roots touch the alter and are absorbed while what appear to be veins appear on the tree that go up into the branches.",
			"The Bone Pit – In an open field there is a 10ft wide and 50ft deep pit with no life growing around it. The walls of this chasm are lined with dark cobblestone and going down there are three uneven sized holes that are covered by iron bars. At the bottom there are a large pile of bones.",

			"The Ol’ Inn – The ancient ruins of a strangely ‘modern-looking’ tavern located in the deepest patches of forest. No path leads to it, no other buildings or ruins are found besides it, but dozens of deformed footsteps can be found heading out of the site. At night, the faint, muffled sound of a single viol can be heard coming out of the muddy floor.",
			"The Forgotten Emperor’s Statue – An incredibly detailed, broken bust of a young wood elf, bearing a red crown. Its nose and left ear are missing and where its left eye should be, the socket is destroyed, and a monstrously decomposed snake eye can be found. The base has a bronze plaque which reads (in broken Celestial): ‘The only one truly meant to rule’, followed by a name which seems scratched out.",
			"The Candle Trees – deep in the woods, a small group of trees whose leaves are bright red. They contrast starkly with the normal trees around them. The Candle trees appear otherwise normal, but the dried leaves can be brewed into a tea that warms the bones even on the coldest nights.",

			"Impossible Shipwreck – Dashed upon the rocks are the remains of a large merchant ship.

The most peculiar thing about this is that the rocks, and ship, are in a cavern 100ft underground, miles from the nearest navigable waters.",
			"Sapphire Beach – a small stretch of coastline hidden between two nigh-inaccessible cliff faces. The sand is particularly fine and a brilliant blue. Rumor has it that the sand was formed when giants destroyed the jewel horde of a local dragon. There are also rumors of a dragon being sighted in the oceans nearby. Digging deep into the sands turn up giant bones.",
			"The Lovers’ Spring – a secluded hot spring, with the initials of many young lovers carved into nearby rocks. Discarded and forgotten undergarments can be found on tree branches in the area.",
			"The Arms of the Last Bard – A broken but thick 15ft wide half-circle embedded to the ground made of quartz and intricately laced with gold strips. An assortment of precious gems are embedded in its surface. Any attempt to collect and/or destroy this construct will cause severe psychic damage and a loud high-pitched tone to play loudly. The half-circle aligns perfectly with sunset/sunrise and every time it does, the most beautiful flute melody plays that is sourceless.",
			"The Iron Tree – A big, old tree which seems to be made of iron, but as far as anyone can tell, is alive and growing, if slowly.",

			"The Charity Cave – A cave with a chest that says, ‘if you take something, leave something.’ It’s unlocked and has several trinkets inside.",
			"The Eye of the Moon – on top of this hill is a pool surrounded with stone. The water is always cool, and at night the full moon can always be seen in its reflection, regardless of clouds or moon cycle.",
			"Bigfoot – A large tree in the forest that bends and splits in such a way that the bottom looks like a foot, with toes.",
			"Goddess of Death Statue – A worn smooth but still recognizable ancient statue of a goddess of death. At her feet sets a black stone bowl filled with fresh rose petals. If you were to kneel down at the bowl and look up at her, you would see her eyes stare unwaveringly into yours.",
			"The Red Altar – in the middle of a copse in a strange swamp lies a smooth altar made of red stone, with strange carvings of trees and water all around its base. Upon touching the altar, you will hear a voice in your mind ‘sacrifice”, and you will feel a strange primal urge to sacrifice a creature on top of it.",
			"Timnar’s Beard – A copse of trees growing in a single spot on an otherwise barren mountain. Unbeknownst to the world, it is the burial place of a great wizard of earthen magics. It is watched over by a trio of stone golems and a handful of slumbering treants to guard the immense knowledge held within the tomb.",
			"The Sundered Mount – a mountain that appears to have been cleaved in two and creating two crumbling peaks with a narrow cut of a valley between them. It does not appear naturally created.",
			"The Mage Wastes – A region where fertile grassland suddenly stops and abruptly becomes a barren wasteland of decaying grass and reddish soil. It seems as if it was the sight of some magical battle. The ground is pocked with craters and scorch marks, yet it seems as if this battle was an ancient long finished, but the battlefield has remained a wasteland frozen in time.",
			"The Dragons Maw – A series of jutting tooth like spires of black igneous rock which rise out from the sea. These “teeth” have proven to be an extreme hazard to sailors and shipping which pass too near to them. Tearing hulls and ripping sails.",
			"The Gods Sacrament Statue -A old weathered statue of a god with beautiful gems inlaid and surrounded with wicker basket offerings of gold, flowers, food, and trinkets.

Award inspiration for respectful offerings or prayers given to the statue.",
			"The Dragonblood – A massive artwork carved into a boulder placed some ways away from the banks of a nearby river. The artwork seems to depict a struggle between giants and dragons, with the giants as the victors. The faintly red runes which line it are giantish, and anyone who can decipher them will read that it marks a momentous battle between giants and dragons, over which should decide the course of the river.",
			"The Daughter of the Sun – An enormous stone of a singular soft yellow color. It is hot to the touch but by day it is warm and comfortable simply standing near it.

			"Mage-Crater – a 120ft diameter crater. Now filled with water and inhabited by pond creatures.",
			"The Old Man – a natural rock formation that just happens to look like the face of an old man with a long beard.

			"Dwarven Monument – An enormous high relief of six dwarven warriors cut from a cliff pointing the way along, commemorating their epic journey.",

			"The Weeping Sister – A fifteen-foot statue of a girl unmarred by time. Next to her are the shattered remains of another statue, close enough that the body may have once held her outstretched hand. The feet of this larger statue are all that remain affixed to the earth – the rest is scattered throughout the clearing. Water, clean and pure, travels down her face in steady rivulets but leaves no erosion there.",
			"The Sensible Stone Head -a large stone head protruding from the surface of a glacier. It is the head of an earth elemental and if you get his attention, he is friendly.

			"The Titan’s Blade – A 50 ft rust covered sword driven into the earth. The whole area has a magical aura and no wildlife lingers within a quarter mile of the sword.",
			"The Well of Good Tidings – A well by the side of the road that is a base in a local hafling tradition that if one where to lose a tooth, that it is to be tossed in the well with a tip of the hat. When doing so, good fortune is sure to come. Characters that throw in teeth later find small amounts of wet coins in various locations on their person. Characters that throw rubbish, or are otherwise disrespectful of the well, find their respective objects on their person once more soaking wet and covered in bite marks.",
			"Skilltown – A small but clearly once-bustling town lays abandoned inside of a titan’s skull. The skull is half buried in the sand; its eye sockets and mouth aim up at an angle. Walking through its mouth is the only way to enter the town. The skull looks to be that of an enormous version of whatever scariest creature lives in that area. It provides ample shade during most of the day.",
			"Best Rest Graveyard – A cleric once prayed over a graveyard that all within would ‘rest well.’ Now anyone who falls asleep in that graveyard has the best night of sleep they’ve ever had.",
			"Bird Hill – a grassy hill of noticeable height rises from the otherwise flat plains. On the hill are several lines of cobblestone that do not grow grass and have no discernible pattern from the surface. If flying, however, you see the cobblestone lines form the shape of a bird, along with some arcane symbols. If you happen to look up during the spring or fall, you’ll see migratory birds alter their course to fly over this hill.",
			"Stairway to Nowhere – All that remains of an ancient fortress, the remarkably well constructed staircase rises for 3 stories out of the ground at the end of an ancient road, and then just abruptly stops.",
			"The Crossroads – This is the place where four kingdoms meet. The main road for each lead to a massive stone pillar. Many years ago, all four kingdoms were at war, and a pillar was placed there as a symbol that none from neighboring kingdoms would be allowed to cross. It is now an annual meeting place for the four to discuss their continued amnesty.",

In the center of the circle, where the meteor should have been, there was nothing, not even a small crater.",
			"The Well – A seemingly normal well on the top of a hill. Anything that is placed into it is immediately tossed out of it.",
			"The Pariah’s Mountain -One mountain among an otherwise unimpressive range, its only defining feature is its completely upside down. The base measures about 60ft across, but the peak 3,000ft up is easily a mile across. Stairs may have been carved into the side, but the climb down to the summit (or is it up to the base? The locals aren’t quite sure) is precarious at times. The locals are also similarly vague when asked about what’s on top…",
			"Worried stones – A group of 3 standing stones with anxiety. When encountered in their clearing, they will disappear once all eyes are off them. Careful inspection will reveal them to hiding nearby – peeking from behind a nearby tree, bottom of a lake, hidden by bushes, behind where the party is now looking, etc. If discovered, they disappear again if not observed. The stones are not malicious, and do not harm the party. They would just rather you all left them to it, thank you.",
			"The Quiet Creek – An otherwise ordinary creek that runs through a forest. It is abnormally quiet near the stream, in such that there is almost no echo around it, and it is surprisingly hard to hear from a distance. All along its course stand small boulders, almost fully grown over with moss.",
			"The Shifting Hills – A large field of hills, dotted with rocks, grasses, and flowers. Careful study has found the hills are constantly moving, as though old creatures crawl along under a carpet of earth. Magics which call upon the earth always seem to produce unexpected results when among them.",
			"The Devil’s Wager – A large disc shaped stone at the base of a long dormant volcano. Visitors toss a copper at it for good luck. There are a couple hundred copper around it. It is considered extraordinarily bad luck to take the coppers.",
			"The Swordleaf Trees – there is a patch of trees here with a non-stop turbulent wind rustling the leaves and branches violently. The leaves’ edges appear to be razor sharp.",
			"Beacon Mountain – A mountain that, on some nights, has a bright ball of light form over it which slowly dissipates over several hours. Local religion strictly forbids climbing the mountain.",
			"Mist Valley – a short pathway of stone carved into a mountain, roughly five feet wide with names of couples and graffiti on the stone walls. The pathway always has a thick fog settled over it, making it seem eerie.",
			"Ancient Battleground – Deep in a forest, trees are marred with years old axe and sword marks. Hundreds of skeletons dressed in rusted armor and weapons lie in this area. Taking a trinket, or even loitering may be unwise.",
			"True Clarity Bridge – A bridge between two high places that, for many people, while staring off the side, provides answers for their most troubling issue or deep question, whether they were looking for the answer or not.",
			"Lover’s Glade – Two sequoia trees whose bases are over a hundred feet apart have grown together and connect about 160 to 180 feet off the ground. The branches and leaves of these giant trees create a pleasantly shaded area below which is often used by the local populace as sites of wedding ceremonies.",
			"Round Rock – A mysterious perfectly round rock that stands nearly 20ft tall. It is too heavy to roll and never seems to chip. It is the center of many local legends, varying wildly on their truthfulness."

			"Ow, my leg kinds of hurts. Oh my god, I’m dying!",
			"I think she suspects. I have to tell her. How do you tell someone they are married to a Gold Dragon?",
			"…and I shall call it ‘flux capacitor’.",
			"I’ve seen this person in my dreams every night for 5 years.",
			"I really need to get this conversation over with – I have to meet with the boss in a little while.",
			"I’m sure they’ve seen the tear in my cloak already. I was hoping to repair it, but I just had to see someone before I had the chance to. I’m sure they think I’m just a slob now.",
			"Oh I’m going to befuddle those adventurers so hard!",
			"Did I just step in feces? Wait, is that brain matter?",
			"Kill. (repeated up until the user identifies the threat)",
			"It went well, right? I hope she liked me. What if she didn’t? What if she thinks I’m a loser? Oh, gods.",
			"Oh Hells I left my sword at home. Something doesn’t feel right about this place. I wonder if- BY THE GODS SOMEONE HELP.",
			"Erotic thoughts about the user of the spell.",
			"If he says that one more time I am going to scream. He is so irritating. I can’t stand him. Oh he has finished…quick, laugh.",
			"Maybe the halfling will die next time. It has to happen soon. He is living on borrowed time. We can’t carry his ass forever. I wonder if I could wangle his magic dagger?",
			"I wonder how long this is all going to take? He will be waiting for me",
			"Ow ow ow. This is agony. It hurts so much. I can’t show them. They can’t know.",
			"I think that wench gave me somethin’.",
			"Scandal was only ok last night.",
			"Half of me wants to know what happened last night while I was drunk and the other half knows I should save time and just leave town and never come back.",
			"Can this guy read my thoughts? AHHHHH. No, he didn’t react. Guess not.",
			"Tomato, tomato. It makes no sense! Who the hell pronounces it tomato! (With the DM’s choice as to which pronunciation will most set off the party. Expect vigorous out-of-character discussion soon after).",
			"Would you look at those adventurers. Ah I used to be an adventure like that! Until I took an arrow to the knee.",
			"Oh gross, that (PC spellcaster’s race) has a bit of spinach stuck in his/her teeth.",
			"Bread, butter, cheese, vegetables, a new cooking skillet…damn, what else was there?",
			"Does anyone really wonder why there are no half dwarves?",
			"Hm, I could eat. Not a lot, but like a snack. Turkey leg maybe? (if PC is kenku or aacrakocra) I wonder what this one would taste like? Is it cannibalism if they’re a bird person?",
			"(Caster) is looking at me kind of weird right now… do I look weird? Smile, nod, look at the lips not the eyes, oh man that’s a lot of nosehair.",
			"Thoughts register as a dull roaring sound, followed by a whisper from a voice that manages to be sonorous and rasping- Hello wizard.” The target continues to talk blithely as your mind fills with the roaring and a demented laughter.”",
			"They’ll never find the body.",
			"Wait, can they see me watching them?",
			"Boy it’d be a shame if somebody found the horde of gold I dug here last night.",
			"The explosive rune should go off in 10…9…",
			"Sniggering “Nobody ever realises I’m the Prince.”",
			"At last, my most evil plan is coming to fruition. Thank goodness nobody has realised it’s me, I’m completely alone.",
			"I just need rope, a pineapple, several iron rods and firewood. That should do the trick.",
			"Absolute Nothingness.",
			"Somebody playing and replaying a game of dragonchess in their heads.",
			"The image of a person slowly taking off their clothes, followed by shy kissing and then a beautiful love scene at night by a fireplace.",
			"Did I leave the stove on?",
			"Gods, he/she (caster’s gender) is so hot. I bet he/she would sell for a fortune. Who knows, the slavers might even let me keep the outfit. Looks expensive, I could probably make a bundle just selling that. Alright, first things first, gotta seduce him/her.",
			"…HIJKLMNOP, QRS, TU… Damn it! I keep on forgetting! T. U. A pause …W? No, that can’t be right. Why am I having difficulty with this, I just went over them yesterday! Oh whups, looks like he/she (caster’s gender) is staring. There’s no way he/she knows, right?",
			"It just doesn’t make sense. Why would there be a fruit called a grapefruit when there is already a fruit called a grape? At the very least, it should be called a grapefruit fruit. To distinguish it better. Distinguish it more. Either or.",
			"Alright, now exhale. Inhale. Exhale again. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Subtlety check the area… Oh crap, Inhale. Wait, I already did Inhale, its Exhale now. Exhale. There we go. Inhale. Good, looks like no one has noticed that I’m a mouth-breather.",
			"Did I make a pact with an actual unicorn last night, or was that just a really weird dream?",
			"I wish my mother would pass already.",
			"[SO]’s making pot pie tonight! I’m so excited!",
			"Who are these stupid awful people talking to me right now?",
			"I didn’t technically steal that locked case, I only found it after it fell off of that merchant’s cart. But I still can’t get anyone to open it for me because they’ll want me to return it or accuse me of theft. Best to just keep it under my bed for now.",
			"My nose itches… can they stop talki g already?? This is driving me mad.",
			"Oh, they smell. That’s disgusting. What is that, three weeks of sewage and dog hair?",
			"Can dwarves even get drunk? That was a bad wager to make.",
			"BE A MAN, must be swift as a coursing river… how does the next bit go? (Or some other song is stuck in their head)",
			"Now, eggs are cheap right now, so if I get a rooster or two, I can really expand my flock. After a month or two, prices should be back up.",
			"I don’t get why the Missus is so upset… I thought she wanted a floor scale! I thought she’d like it! What did I do wrong?",
			"I hope Richert’s okay. I rarely hear from him these days. I told him the military was a bad choice, but noooo. He had to go leave me with the twins.",
			"Why did I have to be the one to be (NPC’s name here)? They’re so lame. Next time, I want to be a duke or something. Much more exciting life.",
			"These aren’t my pants! Why am I wearing someone else’s pants?!",
			"Really, does no-one else find Orcish women hotter than all other women. Am I alone on this? I can’t be the only one turned on by the tusk’s right? Right!?!",
			"I’m sooo tired! Can’t let anyone know, or they’ll think they have an advantage in combat!",
			"If I build a machine with wings, shaped so that the air pressure is higher below the surface of the wing, perhaps I could achieve non-magical flight… no it’ll never work. I’ll always be a turnip farmer.",
			"Strange. I was sick, then I got better, but my wife got sick soon after. Maybe there’s some kind of… tiny little creatures… so small we can’t see them… that transmit sickness between people… and common illnesses could be avoided by, say, washing your hands to drown the tiny creatures… let’s call them, ‘germs’… no, it’s ridiculous. I should just get back to farming turnips.",
			"Hmmm. If I could build a spinning device, powered by, say, steam, why not, and attached it to a rod that turned, say, some wheels, and put that together into a machine with room for a person to sit, and maybe, a wheel to steer… ah, too ridiculous. I’ll always be a turnip farmer.",
			"If I dropped out of my job and went into farming, I could use my druidic contacts to help cultivate my land, and my discoveries in agriculture to farm the greatest turnips the land has ever seen… no, give it up. You’ll always be a poor inventor.",
			"I really should take Casey to the doctor. That bump on the head didn’t sound good.",
			"If you cut a troll in half, does each half grow into a new troll? Isn’t that how worms work?",
			"These pants are tighter than I remember.",
			"The cult will not be happy if I don’t bring a live owlbear for the ritual… but how would I get one there alive?",
			"I wonder what excuse I’ll ha e to find to beat my son this time.",
			"I feel that my deity _______ doesn’t fit me, maybe I should change my devotion to _______.",
			"I was the one that clogged the outhouse the other day. It was me. And everybody will think it was him, ha!",
			"I know you’re trying to hear what I’m thinking,” as the target stares right at the user.",
			"Dragonborn are just glorified lizardmen who deserve to be treated as such, not as a human. How do they even reproduce? Do they lay eggs? Disgusting.",
			"I have one goal: Assassinate [PC’s Name]. Should be easy, right? If only I could find the opportunity, then I can grab that sweet reward.",
			"Cheese, with a …. Pickle, yes, in a sandwich, wait do I have any bread left. Oh I have that nice chutney.",
			"I have been working straight for two weeks and I did his laundry yesterday, he is going to have to let me go for the weekend.",
			"He/She has been so distant lately, and I am sure the bed was made when I left, then again He/She gave me that new belt, that means they still love me surely.",
			"OK, relax. Breathe. No one is looking at me. Blend with the crowd, blend with the crowd, they don’t see me, I’m not here. A little closer. Deep breath. And… Go!",
			"Don’t make eye contact, look right past her. Hand it to over and walk away. Easy-peasy. Shit, where is it!? Pockets? No. Jacket? No. Shit. Oh yeah, I remember I put it in my shoe. Thank the gods. … Why did I put it in my shoe!? How am I supposed to discreetly get anything out of a shoe that has a foot in it!? Ok, privacy, privacy, where can I go? I gotta find an alley.",
			"That’s right you idiots, buy my piss bread. Made with 100% organic free range grain fed elven piss. Yeah, smell it you asshole. Mmm, doesn’t that smell good. Guaranteed fresh.",
			"God, these people stink.",
			"I hope the clerics didn’t notice I took some of the tithe…",
			"Where’s Piero? He was supposed to off the girl and get out of there… Did he get caught?",
			"Must…resist…urge to feed… blood…BLOOD…",
			"Oh god I said ‘You too’ when I should have said ‘Thank you’ now she thinks I’m an idiot. I can’t come here ever again.",
			"What is he wearing? How do people get to that age and not know how to pick out clothes.",
			"If I had only wed Margaret my life would be so much better.",
			"It’s such a beautiful day today, maybe I’ll stop by the creek to fish later. Oliver would love it if I brought some fresh ones home for him to cook.",
			"I wonder how long this is going to take? I have a potion brew that needs dire attention or else it might explode.",
			"I hope no one notices my shapeshifting is off today.",
			"Only a few more hours till I can add her hair to the shrine…",
			"I brought her flowers, but… what if she didn’t like them? Was I being to forward? Like three weeks ago she said something about disliking men who waste their money. Flowers just die. Maybe she thinks I’m a financially incapable idiot I have ruined my chances, oh my god.",
			"If I just kept walking off into the woods I wouldn’t have to be here anymore. No one would even miss me. It’d be so simple…",
			"I can’t tell if she noticed I’m wearing my nicest dress today. Maybe I should casually walk by her post again? I woke up an extra hour early just to lace up the bodice she’s damn well gonna see it.",
			"A mocking high-pitched repetition of what anyone nearby is saying, followed by “Jackass”.",
			"Today will be different. I’m turning it all around. I’m not going to step foot in a tavern ever again. I’ll change and I’ll win him back.",
			"I can’t wait to see her face when I throw that surprise party for her!",
			"If they open that door, I will have to kill them."

			"You are teleported into a sealed crate that appears to you to be moving….",

			"The universe moves, but the caster is kept in one place. The effect is indistinguishable from successful teleportation unless someone else was teleporting at the same time.",
			"The caster is transported to another dimension where they are forced to fight progressively more difficult opponents in an arena. When they are eventually killed, their teleportation is completed and they revert to their previous age.",
			"The same as above, but with them living out a vividly-described happy life with a family.",
			"Two people teleport. They exchange eye colors. Maybe just one eye changes.",
			"A person looks physically younger. Apparently, they were clones, not teleported, and all of their dying cells were replaced with new ones. (The soul is fine though).",
			"Two people teleport. Their souls switch bodies.",
			"A person’s hair doesn’t teleport! They’re bald after teleporting (including facial hair).",
			"A person teleports ‘slowly’…meaning the visibly see the astral sea, hell, celestia and other planes as they zip through them. It takes a full second but feels like hours.",
			"The caster is briefly teleported to a treasure vault filled to the brim with gold and valuables. They are returned to their original position shortly after.",
			"The party’s minds are randomly switched.",
			"A random creature has been picked up while the magic trail travels. Roll 1D6 to find: 1. An ancient green dragon. 2. A beholder. 3. A frost giant. 4. A beholder zombie. 5. A blood hawk. 6. A giant frog.",

			"The teleportation ends 1d20 feet over the ground. Caster/Group needs to succeed saving throw or take fall damage.",
			"Caster/Group feels a sudden illness. They throw up immediatly.",
			"The teleportation has some stopovers on random locations for 1d4 seconds each. The visit e.g. a battlefield, a dragon’s nest, a feast of a king, a brothel, the middle of an ocean, … before they reach their final destination.",

			"The teleported player or players are teleported into the stomach of an enormous creature (whale). There is a half broken ship with a skeleton of an old man and a wood puppet. In the ship is a crystal that changed the teleportation so they can teleport away once they have the stone. It crumbles as they teleport away.",

			"The caster is teleported into an empty seat at a warm, cozy inn. A door remains closed on the far side of the room, and there are no windows to be seen. Soft, upbeat music is constantly being played by a talented bard in one of the room’s corners, which somehow gives the caster a feeling of home. There are always enough patrons that the inn feels lively but not uncomfortably crowded, and waiters and waitresses bustle around providing delicious drinks and hearty meals. An innkeeper immediately rushes over to the caster and informs them that their room has been covered, as well as all their food and drink. As the inn’s fare fills the caster’s belly and the patrons begin to socialize with them, the caster becomes less and less inclined to leave. In actuality, the inn and all its original occupants are part of a small sentient pocket dimension that feeds off of feelings of contentment and satisfaction. The pocket dimension snatched the caster up in the hopes of keeping them inside it as a permanent source of sustenance. Exiting through the far door instantly transports the caster to their intended destination.",
			"The caster appears 30 feet above where they initially teleported, pressed flat against the palm of a massive ethereal hand. The hand quickly and viscously swats the caster down to the ground, causing them to take 2d6 falling damage and 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The hand then tauntingly waves it’s index finger back and forth before popping out of existence. Any attempts in the general area to teleport within 10 minutes of the original casting causes this mishap to repeat, targeting the new caster.",
			"The caster randomly teleports between the two locations for the next minute. Any movement relative to the point of casting and the point of impact is translated across teleportations.",
			"The spell appears to fail, when in actuality the effects of the spell are delayed by one minute. An evil clone of the caster appears at the intended point of teleportation and does its best to cause all manner of mischief and mayhem, though it does nothing that would be very harmful or potentially deadly to itself. After one minute, the clone pops out of existence at the same time the caster is teleported to the position of the clone.",
			"A violent, fiery explosion occurs at the point of casting as the caster rapidly shoots into the sky, breaking every surface in their way. The caster disappears into the clouds and descends to their intended point of teleportation one turn later, breaking all surfaces along the way and causing a similar explosion to the first at their point of impact. All creatures within a 15 foot radius Sphere other than the caster must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d6 fire and 5d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or have as much on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by more than 5, they are deafened for one minute and knocked prone.",
			"Your skeleton arrives at the spot, but not you. You’ve stayed behind and slowly collapse into a bunch of folding flesh. Have a nice day.",
			"You point at a spot and cast teleport. You find that you are standing on a piece of dust several hundred feet across. The spell had miniaturized you, in order to appear at that location. The dust is slowly drifting away on a slight breeze and it’s taking you with it.",
			"They arrive just in time to watch future versions of themselves create a paradox and explode. Salvage what you can from the pink goo.",
			"A random party member secretly changes alignment for 1d4 days.",
			"A random party member becomes ethereal for 1d4 hours.",
			"The group creates a flux where they alternate between two places at once. A coin flip determines if they deal or take damage. Lasts one day.",
			"‘Where are my feet?’ The party falls over in agony missing a vital part of their anatomy. The feet reappear soon after. The party vows to take better care of their feet.",
			"Passing through a Quantum Leap they no longer look like themselves. The change of identity persists until they finish a quest.",
			"An exact copy of the Taj Mahal appears next to them. Each PC has a key in their hand to a different door in the complex. The last key opens a crypt filled with dead bodies in various states of decay.",
			"You come to in a strange land. Free of conflict, strife, and famine. The alien populace welcomes you with open arms. You live a beautiful life and live to see your children and grandchildren grow up happy and healthy after intermarrying with the aliens. In your twilight years you sit on your deathbed along with your fellow PCs. Your mournful spouses kiss you goodbye as you close your eyes one last time…then you arrive at your destination as if none of it ever happened.",
			"Animated, talking copies of your skeletons appear next to you. Flip a coin to determine if they are friendly or hostile… and your mom said you couldn’t make new friends.",
			"The party’s bodies and equipment are left behind but their souls make it to the destination, their bodies become dormant until their souls (now in ghosts form) can make it back to their bodies.",
			"The party’s bodies and equipment make it to the destination but their souls are left behind, their bodies become dormant until their souls (now in ghosts form) can make it back to their bodies.",
			"The party appears unharmed but surrounded by 2,000 pancakes. No syrup or butter though.",
			"They appear in a crop circle next to a very bewildered farmer. He sells corn for 2 silver coins per bushel.",
			"They are possessed by mischievous spirits. Have the players lip sync Harry Belafonte’s ‘Day-O’ or they stay possessed for another 1d4 days.",
			"Everyone becomes under the effect of the gaseous form spell.",
			"Water seeps out of all of their orifices in steady trickles (Advantage on escaping grapple but Disadvantage on Stealth & Perception checks).",
			"You arrive where you wanted, but 5 years too late.",
			"Rather than teleport over a distance, everyone involved instead teleported 1 hour forward/backward in time for every 10 feet the teleport would take them.",
			"The caster put a bit too much accent on the last syllable, and the party is scattered around the world.",
			"The party is successfully teleported… but exact copies of them are left at the origin site, wondering why the spell didn’t work. The party now exists in duplicate in different places.",
			"You teleport to another dimension. This dimension is limbo, but in the middle of no where, as you look around you, you see barren waste land as far as the eye can see. The ground is blackish brown, and the dirt is cracked and dried up. For the next few minutes, you hear deceased relatives, and deceased friends call out to you. They yell for your help. You can see where they they are, floating as specters/ghosts. But as soon as you attempt to approach them, you feel you soul and body get hot as your dragged away and teleported to the original desired location. No time has passed since. Any party members teleporting with you did not feel this effect, only the one who cast the teleport spell experienced it. Roll a d20. If the result is Even, nothing happens.

During these 4 hours, the PC can not make intimidate checks nor persuasion checks, if they attempt to, they are automatic fails.",

			"You come across an older gentleman traveling down the path with a group of 6 small dogs walking behind him. He has them each on a small leash that is attached to his large backpack, filled with dog clothes and toys. Over the last few years, this man has trained these dogs to preform tricks. He is traveling from town to town to try and become a famous performer.",
			"You pass a person draped in flowing red and gold cloth, eyes closed and performing what looks like an incredibly slow dance. Around them are several unconscious bandits.",
			"You see an old woman with a young girl that is slowly moving towards your group. When you come closer you notice that the woman is actually blind, and the girl is guiding her. That woman gets intense when you come closer and gives away a series of phrases, each of those can be treated as a prophesy.",
			"A pair of newlyweds on their honeymoon headed to a secluded cabin in the woods. They’re both charming and friendly, but the longer you talk to them, the clearer it is that something’s amiss. Specifically, it’s very clear that the groom has quite a lot to gain in the event of the bride’s untimely demise.",
			"You kick a rock, and it appears to grow legs and claws. On close inspection, it is a fist-sized crab disguised as a stone. All rocks in the immediate area reveal themselves to be crabs as well, which begin scattering into the grass. If one is captured, it disappears during the next long rest.",
			"A dog leashed to a tree. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else around, but if the party takes the pup its owner will try to find it.",
			"A short woman peddling used magical talismans out of a cart. Her assistant, a large deaf giant who is pulling said cart, grins whenever someone comes near. Her name is Tabitha and she’s rather charming in a soft-spoken way. A bit of prodding into the pair reveals they are both friends who once adventured together.",
			"A man in tattered robes who claims to be nobility who was forced from his home by a wicked sibling. More likely he was kicked out for being a greedy twit, but the party can learn that on their own time as he makes more and more requests.",
			"Two kobolds standing on top of each other wearing an old cloak. They claim they are a famous dragonborn warrior, and they do not seem to know that they are actually two kobolds.",
			"A pair of horses, seemingly abandoned. A further inspection reveals they are still wearing riding tack and seemed to be abandoned in a hurry.",
			"A person digging a grave, with a body of some sort in a shroud nearby.",
			"A lizard folk wearing a paladin’s armor. He poorly impersonates the paladin whose armor he has and pretends to be lawful good. Or maybe he’s had a change of heart after getting the gear. Either way, he’s hungry.",
			"A shepherd with a dozen sheep. He keeps insisting that all the sheep are his and keeps looking over his shoulder.",
			"A 10-man road crew removing a stump from the middle of the road. Four of the crew are armed with bows and complain about a dryad interfering with their job. Two are doing the actual work of removing the stump. The rest are ‘supervising’.",
			"A flash flood has blocked part of the road. A sorcerer is standing nearby offering to clear a dry path for a small fee. The sorcerer is true to their word and forms a dry channel to the other side. After crossing, the channel, the flood and the sorcerer disappear.",
			"A pure black, unnaturally tall Tabaxi. She offers a magical item of the DMs choice in exchange for an interesting story. A player must offer a story that reveals a portion of their backstory and beat a DC 14 persuasion check to receive the item. Each player may attempt this once, but each time it is failed the Tabaxi’s interest wanes, increasing the DC by 2. If the Tabaxi’s DC reaches 20, she retracts, unimpressed, and leaves.",
			"A small and poor family, all their belongings in tow, moving to a new town.",
			"A Firenewt wizard who sells magic minerals, crystals and dusts. He lives in a hut with a large fire in the middle. He spends most of his days at home making powders and crafting near the fire. Although he is not the kindest, he is smart strong and helpful. He sells magical and non-magical jewelry, fireworks, components and ingredients for spells and recipes.",
			"A lonely Bullywug who got lost and lives in a cave. He considers himself the emperor of the cave. He has other frogs and toads as minions and guards.",
			"You see two figures riding on horseback: a halfling and a green dragonborn. They trot along for about a mile until they come across a heavily guarded ornate caravan on the side of the road. As it turns out, the dragonborn is a senator, on his way back from a trip to the outer villages. They stopped to feed and water the horses, and the dragonborn accidentally dropped his keys in the caravan. The halfling is the locksmith from the next town over.",
			"A stray dog, hungry and dirty, desperately needing help. It has a collar with a note attached to it which seems to be a cry for help!",
			"A Rival party of the exact same class but different archetypes. They are a little obnoxious to their counterparts and are out to do the same quest/mission/thing the party is up to.",
			"A black knight traveling on horseback. Could be revealed to be some sort of illusion, or a wandering boss-type monster.",
			"A hungry beggar, who if helped will come to their aid at a later date, if shunned will do the opposite.",
			"A crazy old man who claims to know where a secret forest full of magic is located. You follow him but he is actually just trying to take you back to his home because he has lonely ever since his wife died.",
			"Two older males each riding a giant snail. They sell common magic items, maps of nearby cave systems, and may teach the party how to enhance potions.",
			"A man with piercing blue eyes, all visible flesh but his eyes wrapped in cloth bandages. Adorned in worn and dirty cloths of a nobleman and carrying a religious text. He is polite and intense obviously religious and with a deep silky voice. Upon closer inspection, his flesh appears burned. Omens of doom and death follow in his wake.",
			"A group of guardsmen transporting the corpse of their beloved countess back to her homeland. Upon conversation, the guardsmen believe foul play was involved and ask the adventurers to investigate.",
			"Harrin, the halfling Chef and his employees, all halflings. They travel in search of the Gloomy Mushroom, said to be the most delicious thing there is. A big and gentle half-orc is their bodyguard. His nickname is Joy.",
			"A blind man stumbling along the road with a stick. If the party stop to talk to him, he will talk about how he was the best bandit in the area in his youth. Problem is he never quit when he lost his sight. His buddies are hiding in the wilderness on the side of the road and have been lining up shots on the party with their slingshots and short bows.",
			"A band of travelling bards called Heart of a Dragon on a middle of their ‘biggest tour ever’ where they are playing in multiple cities of the world. They could be a recurring encounter on different roads.",
			"A group of monks on a pilgrimage to a shrine of their order to meditate and receive training.",
			"A travelling circus with a bunch of performers, one of whom is offering to perform their tricks (tarot readings or a future event cryptic reveal) at the side of the road for a couple of coin.",
			"A zealot on a religious pilgrimage to a far-off holy site. The pilgrim has only just started and is full of spunk and cheerful evangelism. This is the pilgrim’s first pilgrimage and up until now has led a very sheltered life.",
			"The wizard Leander from Leander’s Luminous Launderette and Lavender Lavatory. They have been assaulted on their travels, both the wizard and their apprentice were injured (the apprentices wounds poisoned and almost surely infected, gangrenous, and without the help of a cleric; probably fatal.) and their wagon and gear stolen.",
			"A band of highwaymen posing as religious ascetics on a pilgrimage to a nearby temple. They plan to rob the holy site and kill everyone inside its walls.",
			"A farmer and family in tow, with three oxen, two sheep, five pigs, and seven geese following the heavily laden cart. A single rocking chair is perched precariously on top with a grandmother strapped into it.",
			"A travelling troupe of down on their luck performers with a small problem that the players can solve. In their troupe is a budding young master storyteller who is sure to be deeply interested in the players and their stories. Help or Impress them here, and tales of the team’s exploits precede them in the next big city.",
			"A dimwitted farmer who was sold a cat in a bag (and had been told it was a piglet). The farmer is despondent and has spent every penny they had in the hopes of changing their fortune.",
			"A peddler with an old horse and half broken cart who has gotten stuck in a muddy rut. The peddler is actually a spy travelling under cover and the wagon was deliberately stuck to provide an excuse to make contact. Alternatively, the goods the peddler is carrying are obviously stolen from a local power or religious group and the players may or may not know about it happening, and the peddler is willing to do a lot of things to not be caught.",
			"An incompetent adventurer that won’t take no for answer and plans to head wherever the players are going. The adventurer is friendly but seems to be trying too hard.",
			"A knight travelling with a very small, or nonexistent retinue. The knight has been forced to sell his prized warhorse for some reason, or have it knackered due to severe injury. Alternatively, the knight is actually a Paladin doing religious penance and has vowed not to ride a horse or cart for the entirety of one month and one day.",
			"A pack of dirt-covered Dwarf miners’ approach from off the road, offering to trade very valuable gems for some ale and food (‘not trail rations, real food!’). They have just struck upon a massive gem deposit and wish to celebrate. Hope you have some with you.",
			"A hunter approaches, asking for your aid. He is gaunt, obviously hungry. He says he has tracked an Owlbear to a nearby cave, and if you can help him kill it, it will feed his family for a month.",
			"You see a man’s corpse in the middle of the road. A young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen. His throat has been cut. If you stop to examine the body, you quickly see a search party coming toward you from the wood. They are looking for the man. And you should not be so close to him.",
			"You notice an elf slumped against a tree, covered in blood and on the verge of death. He reveals that he is a courier and was ambushed by bandits. He tells you that they didn’t find the message he carries; it is hidden inside his boot. He asks you to deliver the message for him to a woman named Ella Corwyn in the village of Threader’s Hollow, a few days ride out of your way. If read, it is a simple message from her son, Dennis, who is training in wizardry with the elves. If delivered, Ella will feed your group (hearty lamb stew with delicious homemade biscuits) and offer shelter in her barn, alongside her prize pig Josephine.",
			"A bear wearing a vest and derby hat is selling expertly crafted Masterwork musical instruments from an ox-drawn cart hitched to a tree by the side of the road. His name is Sir William Bearington III. He does not speak but can understand and scratch out misspelled replies on a chalkboard in Common. Should you attempt to steal from him, he will attack without hesitation, as a Dire Bear. A small collection of bards of various races have formed an impromptu jam session in a clearing nearby. They sound great, and if asked, they attribute the sound to the quality of the instruments. Anyone with a proficiency in a musical instrument and enough gold in their purse must succeed on a DC 10 Will save or feel compelled to buy one. Prices are high (2x), but the craftsmanship appears to be worth it. A flamboyantly painted sign on the side of the cart in bold calligraphy reads: “Musickyl Innstrumynts of Fynest Make, Experrtly Crafftyd by Sir Wm. Bearington III, Proprytor”",
			"A trio of dirty peasants is riding past on an impossibly fancy carriage. They nervously smile and wave at your group. A DC 18 spot check will notice a smear of blood on the side of the carriage.",
			"You come upon a group of a dozen or so young human men. They carry spears and wear leather armor. They appear to be trying to get your attention. If attacked, they immediately flee. If spoken with, they claim to be soldiers and demand a tax. If refused, they brandish their spears and talk about the wrath of the King but will flee at the first sign of violence. In reality, they are cowards and deserters, trying to make their way South.",
			"A man begs for help. He has been “robbed by bandits. Please, kind strangers, a ride into the village that’s just a day’s travel away?” At the earliest opportunity, he will attempt to steal something of value and ride away on your horse. If it seems like a good idea, he will stab you first.",
			"A very elderly couple flags you down. They ask you to leave some silver as a remembrance for their son, who was killed on this very spot twenty years ago.",
			"A Giant sits in the clearing, he is weeping. The sounds of his tears echo across the open space. His wife was recently killed by adventurers, and he will fly into a rage upon seeing your weapons. If you manage to calm him down, he introduces himself as Urgirr and will beg you to find justice for his wife by killing the Orc Barbarian “Karnak the Bold”, the Human Wizard “Aldo Blackhand”, the Dwarf Cleric “Tordok of the Mountain”, and the Gnome Rogue “Swindlow Duffington Dingle”.",
			"You come upon an impossibly elderly dwarf, naked as the day he was born, standing in the middle of the road demanding a 10 gp toll be paid. He wields a quarterstaff and proclaims himself to be the King of the Road. Thankfully, his long white beard shields his wrinkled nethers from your view.",
			"A longbowman challenges all takers to a hunting contest. A 100 gold bet. Whosoever can kill the most birds in one hour wins the purse.",
			"Morty Mennecaum, a traveling gnome alchemist has set up shop in this unlikely location. His prices are a bit above average, but he loves a joke and will negotiate if someone can make him laugh. His son, Manny, a burly fighter with a Longsword and steel shield, eyes you.",
			"A ghost hovers in your path. He is Gregor Jantos. He asks you to deliver a message to his wife Alya in a nearby town: “It was no accident. Kelvar cut me open to get to you. Don’t trust him.” When you find Alya, she has been married to Kelvar for nine years and they have a daughter together. They are quite the happy family. Gregor died twelve years ago, and he wasn’t well-liked in town. He had a reputation for getting drunk and beating on Alya.",
			"A twelve-year-old boy sits cross-legged atop a boulder that seems out of place near this stretch of road. He wears a circlet of rope around his head. If spoken to, he will open his eyes and acknowledge you and appear to pay attention, but he will not speak. He will answer yes or no questions with shakes of his head. He has taken a vow of silence and is on his way to becoming a Monk. If begged for assistance, he can show you to his monastery where you may sleep, eat, and train for up to a week.",
			"A townsman (Garg) is arguing with a traveling salesman (Phineas). He claims that he paid for 50 miracle cures, but the crate the salesman gave him only contained 46. The salesman claims that the customer must have drunk four of the doses of the cure because he “has a system”. The dispute is over 8 gold pieces.",
			"A traveling salesman blows past you on a cart. He is being chased by half a village who run after with axes and pitchforks. They claim he took advantage of them by selling them colored whiskey in a vial and saying it would cure Miner’s Fever. If you catch the salesman, he claims it’s honest work, selling people hope for an otherwise hopeless disease. He will give back 75% of the town’s money if you Intimidate him (DC 15). If you beat his Intimidate DC by 10 or more, he gives it all back.",
			"A patrol of royal guards is approaching. Six stout men, at least somewhat injured, guarding what seems to be an iron strongbox. They are traveling quickly. They say that they can tell right away that you are trustworthy folk, and they ask you to join them in transporting their incredibly valuable cargo to the King–which is several weeks travel out of your way–promising a small reward for the effort. Should you refuse, they again stress how incredibly valuable their cargo is, and explain that they are tired and weak from their journey, and vulnerable to bandits. If the strongbox is opened (by killing the guards and picking a difficult lock), it contains a letter from another kingdom–a peace treaty.",
			"A group of four small children, no more than eight or nine years old, proudly stops your group. They are adventuring heroes and want to join your party. To kill nasty trolls, and slay horrible dragons, and stay up as late as they want.",
			"A crowd of townsfolk equipped with makeshift weapons and torches is marching towards a nearby city. They proclaim that they are going to do battle with a minor local lord because his taxes are too high. If there is a fight, they will certainly be slaughtered.",
			"A small group of three older women, dressed in homespun and dirty shawls. One woman has a swollen foot and walks with a limp. One has a swollen and infected lip and drools when she speaks. A third has a twisted and infected finger, rendering her unable to grasp anything. One wields a set of shears, one a sack of prepared flax fiber, and a third a distaff and spindle. They are fey in disguise with strange power, prophetic foresight, and strange ethics. Alternatively, they are witches/hags with questionable motives, but a moral code of ‘rewarding’ those who show them respect they feel they deserve.",
			"An etymologist in absurd getup with a comedically large bug net, short shorts, pith helmet, socks and sandals. They ask for assistance catching something only they can see.",
			"You hear them before you see them. As you approach a bend in the road you hear two voices, each loudly complaining about the other. “You said you knew where we were going!” “I said that it was East, you’re the one who said a map was a waste of money!” A female Goliath sits on a fallen tree at the side of the road. A female Halfling is perched on her shoulders passing a wineskin to her companion.",
			"A seemingly normal looking man who greets the party on the road. He will mostly address the party member with the most magic jewelry. After some awkward conversation he will quickly make an attempt to steal the jewelry and run. When the party persuses him he turns into an ancient copper dragon and flies off. They won’t be able to track him. Later if the party is investigating crimes in a nearby city, they might catch word of an illegal magic black market. The copper dragon is the kingpin of the operation and will give the items back when confronted.",
			"The sky darkens and it begins to rain heavily. You see a man coming the other way, carrying a heavy umbrella and wearing a heavy coat. It rains for as long as the man is in sight, and then immediately clears.",
			"Seven dwarven miners bid you good day as they go to work in their mine.",
			"A cartographer passes who is willing to sell a copy of his map of the area for 40gp. With this map the party can travel at an additional 1d4 miles per day of travel within the area of the map.",
			"You find a wandering disciple of Gond (or any other similar god of crafting) who offers to repair any broken or damaged equipment.",
			"A wounded young knight laying down on the side of the road. His quest to save the princess from the dragon had failed, again. He went with a few adventurers and mercenaries, but he was the only survivor left.",
			"A fortune teller sits on the side of the road in a cart that she seems to operate her business out of. There’s a sign on it that explains that a simple fortune is 1 silver, but a more intricate fortune is 1 gold. (If asked to prove her talent, she performs a simple druidcraft cantrip showing tomorrow’s weather and tells them to come back tomorrow to see her if she’s correct. This may be a good place for an insight check). If any party member gets a fortune told, the DM can choose the fortune, or she can foretell imminent death in their path.",
			"A gnome is underneath a curious wagon, fiddling with a mechanical apparatus and swearing up a storm. He refuses help and insists you would just get in his way.",
			"Three high-elven sages can be seen bickering among themselves, arguing over the interpretations of a certain book on Arcana. The party is completely invisible to them if the sages are not addressed/greeted.",
			"A man with bandages over his eyes, a boot slightly larger than its mate, and a sort of mechanical prosthetic hand being led a pseudo natural hound. When questioned about the clearly unnatural dog, he just says ‘I trust him. He led me back out of there’.",
			"A chef with a small restaurant/tavern sets up on a rarely traveled roadside wondering why he never gets any customers.",
			"A tattered old man sitting by the roadside will ask for change to help feed his dog. If you spend enough time with them, the dog reveals itself to be a druid and the pair attempt to rob you.",
			"An elf and a dwarf on a cart pulled by a couple of oxen. Both wear expensive, gaudy clothes. The dwarf is puffing on a clay pipe and has an ornate repeating crossbow on his lap. They offer the party a chance to buy their wares and show them the collection of arms and armor in the cart; all used, some very obviously, with dented armor, nicked blades and blood stains. There are a few good pieces and at a good price. If there are any magical items, the vendors are unaware of this and sell them as standard. These characters make good money from looting battlefields, most of this haul from a recent clash between two nobles’ armies. At your discretion the elf may have a wand or two up his sleeve in event of trouble.",
			"A woman and six small children approach in an ox-drawn wagon. They appear dirty, tired and apprehensive, but if the party is friendly the mother will share her story: the father has run out on his family, and they could no longer afford to live in their previous home. The mother offers the party a single gold coin if they would accompany them to the next village. Rumor has it there are wolves in the area, and they are scared they won’t make it to town before nightfall.",
			"A traveling minstrel and his lover approach on a donkey. He offers to play you a tune for a coin. He is the worst singer you have ever heard. He takes your coin and carries on down the road.",
			"A large magic stone hut. The hut is immune to all magic as well as edged weapons. Inside is the home of a helpful powerful Wizard with many magic items and potions. He has made a shop which he sells him magic for slightly lower prices that the Handbook’s. He will buy any rare magic for 110% of its actual cost. He buys magic at 90% of its actual cost. Lots of people seem to come by in the day and no one seems to be there at night. This is because he talks in his sleep. On any given day, there is a 1/3 chance that he will use d4 spells in his sleep.",
			"Two famous swordsmen, having a duel. One may or may not have cheated in the past and may or may not be planning to cheat in the future. Their followers are attempting to either stop the fight and seeking help or are discussing terms and seeking a neutral arbitrator.",
			"A single, lonely shoe with a busted heel. The shoe is animated, and has a personality, always complaining that ‘My dogs are tired!’. It may or may not be a wizard pulling a trick on you via enchantment.",
			"A traveling artist has set up a canvas in a nearby field and is painting some wildflowers. For 5 copper pieces, he will make a charcoal drawing on paper for you or any of your party members. For 5 gold pieces, he will stop his flower painting and spend time following the party painting a portrait of one of you until he is finished. If prompted about his work, he will get excited and show you his sketchbook. It’s full of various drawings and portraits of people he’s passed on the road. He says he never forgets a face and will even draw someone according to details given by you for 10 copper pieces. He’s surprisingly accurate even if you aren’t the best at describing things.",
			"A portly drunken satyr mostly preoccupied with finding out where the next party is.",
			"A pompous fool of an elf who has spent over 400 years mastering the call of a species of wolf which has since gone extinct in the area. Will demonstrate the howl with almost no provocation and expects you to be impressed.",
			"A portly old goliath in a red coat with white trim dragging a big bag full of presents",
			"Horned devil with a box in his hands. Offers to allow you to take a look inside in exchange for your soul.",
			"A grizzled paladin with a great sword and a floating shield in a desperate fight with two invisible stalkers.",
			"Firbolg sleeping, held in the trunk of his pet elephant who dutifully trundles down the road, stepping politely aside to allow for traffic.",
			"Three hill giants who have been assigned to sack a nearby civilization. They’re lost and want directions from the party.",
			"A hermit, proudly extending his arms towards bypassers, holding a single old sock with a hole on the heel. Loudly exclaiming ‘Look at my sock! Isn’t it wonderful?! This sock has been in my family for generations and never once been wet! It’s not magical nor special, but it is, simply put, the best sock ever made!’",
			"A glum-looking demon lord pulling a wheelbarrow in which is lying a very drunk, very happy dwarf loudly singing ’86 bottles of beer on the wall!’ If interrupted, the cleric burps loudly, frowns and then shrugs, starting again at ‘1 billion beetles of butt in the well’ before giggling and falling asleep. At this the demon lord sits down and begins weeping.",
			"An old man and his four mute sons, all dressed in rags, one carrying a large walking stick. In truth, the old man is the head of a giant mage, and his ‘sons’ are his limbs, polymorphed into a group of humans. The old man will ask for a share of the party’s rations, and his sons will eat and eat until no food is left.",
			"An oddly smelling gnome with various magic items hidden under his cloak such as a small pocket watch that turns you invisible for six seconds, a hand with candles on its fingertips that when lit paralyze every creature with 14 or more charisma in a 100ft radius, and a blank booklet that does nothing but looks extremely important to all creatures who see it.",
			"Angmar Bladewalker – human knight – Brown hair and blue eyes, she proudly wears a scar across one side of her face. She is always a bit late, a bit eccentric, and has an otuyagh in the stables that she raises as a pet. Deft with a blade though. She moved out of her house because it was haunted.",
			"Zane Drake – High Elf poet – He has very long, curled, brown hair shaved on the left side and brown eyes, with rough golden skin. He has a soft, typical face with a short moustache. He speaks loudly and dramatically at all times. In addition, he knows the true name of an angel.",
			"Ayleth Falavaul – Half-Elf merchant – She has long, curled, dyed black hair and green eyes. She speaks quietly at all times and is deeply religious. Her homeland was destroyed by a storm.",
			"Doran Thunderdelver – Dwarf noble – Endlessly impatient, Doran is always shouting about something or other. He has short blond hair and a long beard, which his wife braids every morning. An old friend wants revenge on him.",
			"Porath – Dragonborn wizard – Suspicious and prone to growling, he cares deeply about the local townsfolk. A man named Kavarr stole one of his spell books."
