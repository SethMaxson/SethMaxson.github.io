## History
Once, Lagos was ruled almost entirely by the powerful Lim clan. Over the centuries, their grasp on the continent began to falter as their subjects tired of their often tyrannical rule. This trend continued until the Lim's influence covered only about a quarter of their former empire. This began to change sometime within the last two decades. The Lim empire has begun to expand once more under the careful rule of Pehr Lim, its last remaining heir.
