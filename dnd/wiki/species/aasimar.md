# Aasimar

On rare occasions, a child is born with the blessing of a god. This can be because the gods have chosen them for a greater destiny, as a gift to their particularly holy and faithful parents, or for reasons that are simply unclear to the reasoning of mortals. They are genetically identical to humans, but are more beautiful and long-lived than their kin. While the child resembles its mortal parents, there is an undeniable aura of light surrounding them.

Aasimar can be born to any race, but most recorded instances were born to humans. Consequently, one is most likely to encounter an aasimar near a large population of humans.
