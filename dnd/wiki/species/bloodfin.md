# Bloodfin

The shark-like bloodfin are a relatively new species, indirectly created by the negligent experiments of a mad wizard. They are large, brash, and have a natural inclination to prove themselves the apex predator of any new place they find themselves. Unlike the ocean sharks from which they were mutated, bloodfin are amphibious, and so can live comfortably on land as long as they completely submerge themselves in water for at least one hour each day.

Most bloodfin find the call of the sea too alluring to ignore. While it is not unheard of to meet a bloodfin somewhere inland, most are encountered at sea or in coastal settlements.
