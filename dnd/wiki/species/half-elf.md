# Half-Elf

**Half-elves** (also called Cha'Tel'Quessir in elven) are humanoids born through the union of an elf and a human. Whether a half-elf is raised by their human parent or their elven parent, they often feel isolated and alone. Because they take around twenty years to reach adulthood, they mature quickly when raised by elves (who think they look like humans), making them feel like an outsider in either place.


## Description

## Personality

Half-elves, as a result of their unique heritage, exhibit a confidence and strength of personality uncommon amongst both humans and elves, a result of the blending between elven perceptiveness and human passion and drive. Half-elves are natural leaders and negotiators, and, perhaps because of their reality of living in two worlds, are unusually open-minded. Some half-elves manifest this leadership through confidence and bravery, but others are cordial and polite, manifesting their force of personality in a subtler but no less effective manner.

Like elves, half-elves are curious and inventive creatures, though this is coupled with the powerful ambition of their human parents. Half-elves also share a love of the natural world and art with their fey parents.

Half-elves, like their fey parents, are free-spirited and chaotic, with a distaste for overbearing rules and regulations. However, like humans, half-elves lean neither towards good nor evil, and while they value creativity and liberty like their elven kin, half-elves lack the virtuous bent that moderate these tendencies in elves. As a result, half-elves can prove to be unreliable and unpredictable allies at times.

Half-elves generally like to be around others, the more diverse the better. Perhaps due to the circumstances of their birth, or to a simple drive towards diversity, half-elves are often found in large population centers where other races mingle freely. Half-elves naturally gather others around them, forming a large network of contacts that is both pleasing to their psyche and practical for other purposes. In spite of this love for forming connections, or perhaps because of it, half-elves rarely settle down for any length of time and possess a genuine sense of wanderlust, moving from place to place in a way that makes them very natural adventurers. However, whenever a half-elf returns to a place where they have already been, they hunt down old friends and renewed relations.

Though many half-elves are beloved by members of other races, not all half-elves are born to a loving humanâ€“elf couple. Such a troubling past can affect half-elves in many ways, sometimes causing them to become bitter or feel burdened by the past. This leads them into conflict with members of other races, (who often expect half-elves to be friendly and joyful,) in turn putting undue pressure on troubled members of the race.

Ultimately, half-elves endure, both physically and socially. Admired and respected by others of all races, half-elves naturally inspire loyalty and return the fealty with deep friendship and a sense of responsibility. As such, half-elven leaders often lead from the front of a battle, preferring not to send friends or followers into danger that they themselves would not face and putting themselves at risk while inspiring even more devout loyalty.
