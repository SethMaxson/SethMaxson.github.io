# Halfling

Halflings may very well be the closest humanoid approximation of a Golden Retriever. Chipper, optimistic, and loyal to a fault, halflings are delightful traveling companions. While their physical size is well below average, their personalities are often larger than life.

## Description

Halflings are small in comparison with members of most other races, standing somewhere from 2′8″‒3′4″ (81‒100 cm) tall and weighing on average between 30‒35 lb (14‒16 kg). In many ways, halflings resemble small humans and usually have the same proportions as a typical human adult. Most halflings have dark hair and eyes, regardless of their skin complexion which, although commonly ruddy in hue have a similar range to humans.

Nearly all male halflings are incapable of growing true beards, though many have long sideburns. Halfling hairstyles are often complex, with strands woven together or braided. Although halflings have an affinity for collecting valuables, most do not prefer to wear these on their person, instead preferring more comfortable clothing.

Halflings have lifespans comparable with, but slightly longer than, humans. A halfling is typically considered an adult in their early twenties and some live into their 150s.
