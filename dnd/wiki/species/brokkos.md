# Brokkos

Brokkos were created by the gods to protect a sacred island, and dwell in an underground network of tunnels. Brokkos share a very rigid worldview, and believe that all things can be sorted into three categories; Celu (of the sky), Mare (of the sea), or Tarra (of the earth). Brokkos believe that all Tarra is good, all Mare is evil, and Celu contains some of both.

There are few who claim to have seen a brokkos, and fewer still whose claim is truthful. Brokkos are native to a small, uncharted island called Noseyus.
